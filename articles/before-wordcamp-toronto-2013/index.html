WordCamp Toronto is coming up soon! This weekend, 400 people will descend upon Humber College's Lakeshore Campus in Toronto to engage in a few days of WordPress-driven fun.
</p>

<p><a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Toronto</a> (WCTO) has done something a bit different than most WordCamps. WCTO has a bit of a history doing this, though. <a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/wcto-developers-2012/">Last year</a> they were one of the first WordCamps to try a split users/developers conference. While it was a huge success, the doubled organizational hassles were too much in the end, leaving us with a larger combined conference this year. Different for this year, though, is that the second day is composed entirely of panels and workshops.</p>

<p>This means the first day is packed with presentations (4 tracks in total), guaranteeing that all attendees will be able to get something out of it.</p>

<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>

<p>Exciting for me personally is that I’ll be speaking on Saturday! I’m very grateful to the organizing committee for accepting my application, and I’m looking forward to delivering my first ever conference talk.</p>

<p>I’ll be talking to users about how to hire a developer. This talk presents some interesting challenges, because the audience isn’t necessarily one I associate with as well as I do with developers. However, going out of my comfort zone is exciting for me, and I’m confident I’ll be able to pull this off.</p>

<p>The slides for my talk along with a post-mortem will be put up sometime after the conference.</p>

<h2 id="meet-the-people">Meet the people</h2>

<p>Before attending conferences, setting goals is something I believe in doing.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/">WordCamp Montréal</a> I’d wanted to champion discussions about WordPress’ potential role in education. That resulted in some really insightful results, and I’m sure I’ll bring it up again.</p>

<p>However, what I’d like to focus on in Toronto this weekend is getting to know the users. Too often, we as developers get caught up in our own little world and forget that it’s essential that we get to know the people we work for, both financially and otherwise.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I’ll be <a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/get-more-from-talks/">asking questions</a> and sitting in the front rows. These are the best ways to get results out of conferences, and I intend to employ them well.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-countdown">The final countdown</h2>

<p>The weekend is approaching very quickly! WCTO is looking to be an excellent event, and I’m excited to see it all come together.</p>

<p>If you’re in attendance, make sure to give me a shout! I’m more than happy to have a chat at any time during the event. <a href="https://twitter.com/lchski">Send me a tweet</a> or pick me out of the crowd, I look forward to meeting you.</p>
