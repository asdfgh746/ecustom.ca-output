	<div itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This is a story talking about an aspect of my silly childhood. With that in mind, remember that it is a story about my life as a 4-year old and what may sound preposterous was at the time very real to me.</p>

<p>Living in Canada, skating is an awesome skill because by the time winter rolls around it seems like every friend has a skating rink in their backyard, and schools take trips to skating rinks for fun. Learning to skate, then, is an important part of a childhood where you’re not relegated to cling to the boards whilst your hockey-playing friends race each other around the rink, practicing their sharp stops and backwards skating skills.</p>

<p>In order to make sure my childhood would not be devoid of this necessary component, my parents signed me up for skating lessons at a local rink when I was around 4 or 5 years old. To prepare for these lessons, we went out and bought a set of second-hand skates (protip: always buy second-hand for things like skates, and resell them afterwards) at the local used sporting goods store.</p>

<p>So life kept on rolling until the night before the big day, the night before my first ever skating lesson. I was so excited, I’d finally be able to go on the ice and skate and it would be so liberating. However, before I fell asleep that night, a seed of an idea which had been implanted in my head blossomed into a terrifying (and highly irrational) fear.</p>

<p>My 4 year old self had somehow gotten the idea into his head that all ice rinks are built on top of bodies of water like a pond, even the indoor ones. Having learnt some of the basics of ice safety, I knew that it didn’t take much to crack thin pond ice, and when that happened you could fall into the freezing water below.</p>

<p>With these ideas in mind, I somehow contrived that the 6 year old students who already knew how to skate would skate in circles around me. As I wallowed on the ice, trying to skate but constantly falling, their sharp blades would cut a circle out of the ice. So there I would be, sitting on a circle of ice that had been separated from the rest of the rink. Not understanding physics whatsoever, I then guessed that this circle of ice would sink to the bottom of the fictional body of water that lay beneath the surface of the ice.</p>

<p>Of course, this was just a silly childhood fear, but at the time it was very real. I was certain that the horrible, cruel, 6 year olds would for some inexplicable reason decide to cut a hole out of the ice rink and I would sink to the bottom of the water that lay below, a horrible death for a 4 year old.</p>
