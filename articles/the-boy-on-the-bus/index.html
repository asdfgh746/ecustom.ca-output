I met a boy on the bus today. He's 7 years old, in grade 2 at a local school.
</p>

<p>The first thing he said to me was that he was, “[thankful] there’s no bees in the bus!” He went on to describe his life at school. He’s got two teachers (though he’s not sure why), and his favourite thing to do is recess.</p>

<p>He then prompted me to explain that I’m 15 and in Grade 10 at a nearby highschool. (“Wow!”)</p>

<p>Our conversation roamed wildly, as they’re apt to do when one of the participants is a little boy full of wonder. We went on to converse about a wide range of topics, from his love of playing games on his (passed-down) iPhone 4, to his recent trip to Legoland. (I didn’t know we had one. He told me the website and recommended I check it out.)</p>

<p>He then told me that he only plays a few games on his iPhone, because his mom doesn’t make a lot of money and they can’t afford much. He says he looks forward to when he turns 10 or 11, so he can take up a paper route and make some extra money. Very young though he is, he’s already showing a passion and desire to go beyond what life’s given him.</p>

<p>We parted on good terms. I had to get off, and our conversation ran right up until that point. He gave me a high-five and then we went our own separate ways, me to wander home and he to continue on a life of adventure.</p>

<p>Today was <a href="http://sayhi.ca/">Say Hi Day</a>. The smallest things can make the biggest impacts. Get to know the people around you. Their stories will leave a lasting impression on your life.</p>
