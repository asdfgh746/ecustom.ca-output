    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t like doing things without being inspired or inclined to do them. To do so rarely leads to very good results. When doing so I have to force creativity and inspiration, which inevitably leads to a forced-feeling final product. The best solution I’ve found to this is to never force work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day, I’ll have a multitude of projects on the go, whether academic, professional, or personal. However, I find I work best on these when I don’t work on them actively. Instead, I tend to go about my day without working on them, filling it at times with mindless routine and at others with activities meant to activate, stimulate, and challenge my brain. These activities aren’t specifically chosen to result in inspiration for any one of my projects in particular. Rather, I’m trusting my brain (which I judge to be most capable) to be able to make the necessary connections between whatever I’m doing and whatever needs to be done. I’m trusting my brain to draw inspiration from my observations of my environment.  I’m trusting my brain to generate the passion required for great work. Therefore, unless I’m already stricken with the required inspiration and passion to work, I don’t. Instead, I, quite simply, live life. Inevitably as I’m living life, an idea strikes and then I’ll choose one of my ongoing projects to use as an outlet for my response to said idea. This is when real, creative, fruitful work gets done, as opposed to work that’s forced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style of work often annoys others. They question how I’m so sure that a fitting idea will come along in time for me to complete the project by its deadline. The truth is that I’m not sure at all. My method has worked pretty well thus far, and I’ve little worry that it will stop doing so in the future. If that happens, it’ll probably mean that I’ve stopped exercising my brain, in which case I have bigger problems than getting my work done. However, in the event that I’m ever pressed for time and an idea just isn’t coming, I’ve got a solution: impose creative restraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative restraints are great. They’re like the walls of a sandbox. We could play with all the sand and all the shovels on an entire beach, or we could force ourselves to build something awesome using only the sand and tools found within its walls. When we limit the field from which we draw our ideas, it gets a lot easier to find one that works. If you’re pressed for time, then, the answer is simple. Bring down the number of things you can create in that time by employing some creative restraints. Build some walls and forget about whatever’s outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re observant, you may notice that what I’m essentially advocating for—or, perhaps, defending—in this piece is procrastination. I want to say that I don’t advocate mindless waiting, or mindless procrastination. I’m arguing for &lt;em&gt;purposeful&lt;/em&gt; procrastination. I’m arguing for time well spent. I’m arguing for a better quality final product. I believe in waiting for inspiration to come along, spurred on by my own activities. I believe in working because I have the perfect idea to finish one of my projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I don’t believe in working under pressure. That leads to ugly, forced work. I believe in working under passion. That always leads to great results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He battled with the mast, trying to keep it together so he wouldn’t be stranded. As he heard another crack, he paused before continuing his efforts. He thought about his life—about his friends, about his family, about his accomplishments. He realized that he was happy with his life. He had done all that he wished to do, there was no more for him. With that, he knew what he had to do. He quit his fight with a smile on his face, and let the sea swallow him along with his little craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His family began the ceremony with sniffles and tears. “We’re gathered here today to remember a man, a great man who was cruelly taken from us too soon.” The various audience members shook their heads in agreement, mourning what was, to them, a great tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The most horrifying aspect of this is that we lost him before he was ready to go. So much more of his life did he have to live with us, but a cruel force decided we were not to share in it with him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony continued, with audience members taking their turn at the podium to speak about their experience with him. The underlying theme to the words everyone spoke was that his life had been cut short, ended before he–and they–were ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife gave the closing words, “We can rest assured that he did not go down without a fight. I know my husband. As he was on his beloved ship, at no point did he consider giving up. Never did he stop trying to overcome the ocean, to get back to us. We can rest assured that he died trying to come back for us, for the life he loved so much.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Ice Cream Time</title>
    <published>2014-06-04T23:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a special time each night. I call it my “ice cream time”. It’s the period of time I spend each night dishing out, consuming, and appreciating my chocolate ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To others and, to be honest, to myself at times, this near dependency on frozen milk may appear detrimental to me. But I keep at it for more than just habit’s sake, and for more than just because of the chocolatey taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I persist with my ice cream time because of the grander opportunity it offers me for peace. When I’m eating that ice cream, I’m cut off entirely. I’m not tabbing, texting, or tweeting my way to anything that could distract me from that moment. For a person who struggles a lot with the implementation of mindfulness, that opportunity to cut off each night via ice cream is a delightful respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, we’re caught up in a culture which never wants to cut off. Our devices demand our attention, demanding we keep in touch with whomever is on the other side of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes we’re not even using these devices for active communication, choosing instead to use them passively: reading through your Twitter feed, your Facebook stream, or your inbox. We choose to cut ourselves out of whatever is directly at hand, being easily distracted and finding it hard to keep focused on what’s in front of us. Just now, while writing that sentence, I opened a new Facebook tab to check something based on a thought I’d had. Following through on that Facebook activity wouldn’t have generated any further benefit to my writing, the task at hand. Rather, it would’ve just sidetracked me and caused me to forget entirely what I was thinking about. We give up our ability to think and consider when we’re constantly switching what we’re doing. &lt;em&gt;Thinking takes time&lt;/em&gt;, contrary to whatever the makers of our devices and apps want us to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our devices demand efficiency of us. The corollary is also true; we demand efficiency of them. But our demands of efficiency are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demand our phones be quick at loading Facebook so that we can swiftly move on to checking Twitter. After we’ve processed the incremental updates that we’ve received there, we’ll move over to the one new email sitting in our inbox before heading back to Facebook to see what update from a friend is awaiting us. We demand speed from our devices so that we can quickly move on to the next task that they offer us, spending our time with them in a never-ending cycle which provides little appreciable long-term gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does it have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we demand efficiency of our devices for a different reason? Why can’t we demand quick services not to be able to consume many of them in less time, but to be able to consume a service and then &lt;em&gt;move on with our lives&lt;/em&gt;. And not the life tied up in those multiple devices of ours, but the life beyond them. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; life. Yes, I went there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives online are largely fabricated. There’s little disagreement when I assert that, when online, we put forth only our best face. The web is our ultimate bragging grounds, the place where we thump our chests only to perpetuate more chest thumping, and for little reason more. So if we’re spending time curating the best bits of our life for display online, can we actually refer to that as our &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; life? Sure, it’s a part of it, but it isn’t the one we truly experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond our own contributions to the web, consider what it is we’re most often doing here. &lt;em&gt;Passively taking in the activities of others.&lt;/em&gt; We’re not even taking in the curated version of ourselves, but of others! What value can we gain by only looking at the lives of others and comparing our own perspective, an uncensored version of ourselves, to their lives, heavily censored and curated versions of themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is valuable when we use it for active communication. Why don’t we use the web for what it makes sense for, to communicate with others to &lt;em&gt;get things done&lt;/em&gt;? It’s a waste of an amazing resource to do otherwise, a foolish waste of our own lives spent consuming those of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to wake up to the intention of our activities online. We need to be unafraid to cut ourselves off from the distracting, unfulfilling overconsumption made so convenient by the web. We need to focus on &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; lives, on our real lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those lives don’t live on the internet. They live outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some “ice cream time”. Take some time to focus on your life outside of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Distracting Notification Lights</title>
    <published>2014-05-29T21:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just turned off the notification light on my phone. It notified me in a way that caused me to be interrupted from what I was doing. It notified me in a way that took me out of my world and into its, one of incessant demands upon my attention which rarely amounted to much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I must choose to check when there’s something waiting for me in that world of distracting indulgences. It’s up to me to decide when it’s appropriate to stop what I’m doing and check on the world beyond my current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incessant throbbing of the notification light on our phones has become a symbol of the constant demands upon our attention which they so brilliantly exert. By choosing these devices as the ones that may “wake” us from the present moment, from the task at hand, we’re handing our ability to concentrate over to them, making hostages of our attention. Our attention is held hostage when that light’s off. Our attention waits until that light flashes. Then, as it begins its frequent, coloured flashing, our attention becomes enraptured by it, unable to be free until it’s addressed, until we deal with whatever message awaits us on our phone and we’ve forgotten what it was we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might protest that they can work while that light is flashing, but I’d put forth that they are probably just caught up in the unfortunate folly that is multitasking—caught between working on the likely-important task at hand and the equally-as-difficult task of ignoring that blinking light (or, as is more likely, trying to guess what message that light could possibly be hinting at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about the flashing light on phones, but the same could be said of vibrations, or even the “ping” of a new message sound. The flashing light is a particularly bad one, because of its incessant nature and cold, quiet background status. The others, at least, are a bit more intentional in their efforts to awaken us from our focus. That doesn’t make their efforts any more valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to start deciding when it’s appropriate to be interrupted and when it isn’t. When working, especially, we need to put aside whatever can interrupt us. But I think that the notification light is exerting its influence too far into our lives, as we let it interrupt everything from dinner discussions to reading sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present moment is &lt;em&gt;sacred&lt;/em&gt;. Fight your devices to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
