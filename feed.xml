    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Articles about New Year’s resolutions are a dime a dozen this time of year. Generally speaking, I find the notion of New Year’s resolutions to be contrived—why are we choosing &lt;em&gt;this specific day&lt;/em&gt; to choose how we’d like to change ourselves within merely the confines of the coming year? There’s little appreciable gain to doing it this time of year, and yet society, as it so often does, moves as one to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the occasion of everyone else rushing to journal their resolutions for the coming year has given me cause to write up this little piece. It’s been a while since I wrote here, and as always I won’t promise that that will change any time soon. I’ve been spending a lot of time writing for myself lately, and the result of that is less writing which makes it to the eyes of the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you won’t find any New Year’s resolutions in this piece, I will point you in the direction of an essay I’m publishing alongside this article. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-hard-floor/"&gt;A Hard Floor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes a look at how to avoid the issue of complacency—a matter I consider very important, especially this time of year when we consider ourselves to be in a place wherein we are capable of changing ourselves. (As if that’s not possible any other time of year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it could be said that I’m making any New Year’s resolution, it’s that I wish to avoid complacency, as detailed in said piece. By bringing in a change of scenery and new surroundings when appropriate, I hope to avoid the inevitable stasis that complacency brings to all parts of life. I predict that I’ll be changing things up quite a lot in my life throughout the coming year, just as I’ve done this past one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have resolved to communicate better in the New Year, I’d love to get in touch—and stay that way! For communication in 140 characters or less (a limit which is both freeing and yet idea-crushing), you can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where I tweet far too many times a day. For online communication of a longer form, &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;emailing me&lt;/a&gt; will always work. (Though, be warned that with email it may take some time before I have the energy to give you an appropriately considered response.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I love online communication, I’m starting to see through its conveniences for its drawbacks. As such, I’m interested in starting up conversations via pen and paper—using letters, the old fashioned way. I’ve realized that this method has benefits which we overlooked when making the jump to digital methods, and I’d love to get in to regular correspondence with you. If that’s something that appeals to you, all it takes is reaching out to me via either &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; so that we can exchange addresses and get underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I despise the contrived change that people impose upon themselves this time of year, I recognize that it’s still a time of fun and happiness for all. I’m certainly feeling that way, and I hope you are, too. It’s a wonderful time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll close this little update with a quote from one of my favourite journalists. Let this be one of your references in this New Year of change:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One night, I ate my daily dose of chocolate ice cream while sitting on the hardwood floor outside my room. I did this because I’m not allowed to eat in my room. I’d grown tired of my other ice cream eating spots—my living room, my dining room—neither of these held any appeal to me that night. Eating downstairs was out of the question, too; I’d just discovered a great playlist and wanted to be near my speakers so that I could really hear it. So, I sat on the floor outside my room. It was a nice change of scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor was hard, cold, unwelcoming. It was probably the least comfortable spot I could’ve been in to eat my ice cream that night. Even by bringing a chair into the hall, I would have had far more comfortable accommodations by which to eat my ice cream and listen to the great playlist. But I insisted on that hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting there on the floor—my head rested against a closet door, my legs stretched through an open doorway—the contrast of my situation struck me. There I was, in a spot of intentional discomfort. But, even as I was in a spot that my body didn’t particularly enjoy, my mind was very content—happy, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my favourite treat in hand and the music I enjoy most coursing through my ears, I was taken away from my present, actual situation. I was taken instead to a place where my mind was free to focus and think about the things I cared for. By imposing discomfort upon myself instead of accepting the comfort offered and suggested by others, I’d overcome the great beast of complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complacency is a risky affair. Comfort—in whatever form it manifests itself for each individual—is the cause of complacency. But the causes of comfort, too, cannot be ignored: laziness, acceptance, and outside pressures. We can’t let ourselves grow comfortable, for when we do, we sacrifice our ability to engage our minds with new stimuli, with new considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid comfort, we have to overcome its causes. We must remain active. We must be curious, constantly searching for a truer answer. And we can’t cave in to outside pressures. Surpassing the limits imposed by these causes is the way to avoid comfort—the way to embrace discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to engage our discomfort in order to stave off complacency. The complacent are easily overcome, overlooked, and, ultimately, replaced. In order to avoid those unfortunate fates, we have to act now. We have to change the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find your change of scenery. Mine was the discomfort provided by the hard floor outside my room. Yours may be something less, or potentially something far greater. Whatever it is, reach for it when you start to feel the claws of complacency grabbing at you. The change can be temporary, or it could be permanent. It wasn’t one night more before I returned to my other ice cream eating spots. But the key is that I went elsewhere, to refresh my mind and to allow it to take in new considerations. Chances are, even if you return to your old spots after the change, you’ll view them through a newfound perspective. Such perspectives rarely do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you have to do, do it. Wherever you have to go, go there. And when should you do it? Whenever complacency begins grabbing at you. Chances are that that’s the case right now. It’s time for a change of scenery. It’s time for you to find your own hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the new view.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Before WordCamp Toronto 2013</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
WordCamp Toronto is coming up soon! This weekend, 400 people will descend upon Humber College's Lakeshore Campus in Toronto to engage in a few days of WordPress-driven fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org"&gt;WordCamp Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (WCTO) has done something a bit different than most WordCamps. WCTO has a bit of a history doing this, though. &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; they were one of the first WordCamps to try a split users/developers conference. While it was a huge success, the doubled organizational hassles were too much in the end, leaving us with a larger combined conference this year. Different for this year, though, is that the second day is composed entirely of panels and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the first day is packed with presentations (4 tracks in total), guaranteeing that all attendees will be able to get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking"&gt;Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting for me personally is that I’ll be speaking on Saturday! I’m very grateful to the organizing committee for accepting my application, and I’m looking forward to delivering my first ever conference talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking to users about how to hire a developer. This talk presents some interesting challenges, because the audience isn’t necessarily one I associate with as well as I do with developers. However, going out of my comfort zone is exciting for me, and I’m confident I’ll be able to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides for my talk along with a post-mortem will be put up sometime after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="meet-the-people"&gt;Meet the people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending conferences, setting goals is something I believe in doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; I’d wanted to champion discussions about WordPress’ potential role in education. That resulted in some really insightful results, and I’m sure I’ll bring it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I’d like to focus on in Toronto this weekend is getting to know the users. Too often, we as developers get caught up in our own little world and forget that it’s essential that we get to know the people we work for, both financially and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I’ll be &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/get-more-from-talks/"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt; and sitting in the front rows. These are the best ways to get results out of conferences, and I intend to employ them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-final-countdown"&gt;The final countdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend is approaching very quickly! WCTO is looking to be an excellent event, and I’m excited to see it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in attendance, make sure to give me a shout! I’m more than happy to have a chat at any time during the event. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or pick me out of the crowd, I look forward to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-info"&gt;
I met a boy on the bus today. He's 7 years old, in grade 2 at a local school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing he said to me was that he was, “[thankful] there’s no bees in the bus!” He went on to describe his life at school. He’s got two teachers (though he’s not sure why), and his favourite thing to do is recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then prompted me to explain that I’m 15 and in Grade 10 at a nearby highschool. (“Wow!”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conversation roamed wildly, as they’re apt to do when one of the participants is a little boy full of wonder. We went on to converse about a wide range of topics, from his love of playing games on his (passed-down) iPhone 4, to his recent trip to Legoland. (I didn’t know we had one. He told me the website and recommended I check it out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then told me that he only plays a few games on his iPhone, because his mom doesn’t make a lot of money and they can’t afford much. He says he looks forward to when he turns 10 or 11, so he can take up a paper route and make some extra money. Very young though he is, he’s already showing a passion and desire to go beyond what life’s given him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parted on good terms. I had to get off, and our conversation ran right up until that point. He gave me a high-five and then we went our own separate ways, me to wander home and he to continue on a life of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was &lt;a href="http://sayhi.ca/"&gt;Say Hi Day&lt;/a&gt;. The smallest things can make the biggest impacts. Get to know the people around you. Their stories will leave a lasting impression on your life.&lt;/p&gt;
