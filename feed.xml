    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from education systems. They’ve worked for years to find organizational structures that work for them, and we can improve our businesses a lot by modelling ourselves after their proven models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common school models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “integrated” approach, where students from kindergarten to grade 8 are all in the same building.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “dedicated” approach, where the entire school is composed of students in grade 7 and 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each has their own benefits and downfalls. Your business will be better off if you adopt the first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="put-everyone-together-and-watch-progress-happen"&gt;Put everyone together and watch progress happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated approach is awesome for business. Think of each specialty in your team as a different grade. Depending on your business, you might have designers, developers, and copywriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all these talents into close proximity with one another. This lets them work with each other, finding partners who complement their skills so that they can build awesome products together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage passive collaboration like this. It allows skills to come together which might not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-culture-by-encouraging-mingling"&gt;Build culture by encouraging mingling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive collaboration works great, but there comes a time when you need to encourage members of your team to get to know each other on non-work terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this in the schools with “reading buddy” programs, where older grades go read with the younger grades. This is forced mingling, and it helps to build a sense of community by forcing people to meet who may not have otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this community is essential. It becomes the lifeblood of your organization, your company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a good company culture, so encourage its growth by encouraging people to get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting you go right now and tell two people on your team to start reading to each other. Provide venues through which your team gets together and can get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be as simple as your whole team having lunch together (and not talking about work), or as elaborate as a one week retreat to a sunny destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the mingling style that works for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-a-facilitator"&gt;Be a facilitator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers in integrated schools are facilitators. They provide the place for different people to come together, and then they step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do a great service to your business by providing that space for people to come together, both in a working context and in a casual context. Your business should have a work/life balance, and you want the opportunities you afford your team to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring everybody together, both for work and for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For work, you want to put all your skills in one place. There’s little point in separating out these skills, because that creates walled gardens where you have complex processes to communicate between “departments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walled gardens are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For life, you want all your awesome people to get to know each other. Provide opportunities for them to befriend one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, who doesn’t prefer working with friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work hard to bring about these changes within your organization. Run it like a school, and enjoy the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A change of typeface</title>
    <published>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/change-of-face/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve changed the typeface used for the main body copy on this site. It was &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro"&gt;Freight Text Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m now using &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova"&gt;Proxima Nova&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freight Text wasn’t doing it for me anymore. Firstly, it wasn’t rendering very nicely for me. Secondly, I wanted to change away from a serif face. We’re used to reading sans-serif on the web by now, I don’t see a need here for a serif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with changing the typeface, I also decreased the overall type size. It was far too in your face previously. One of the skills of a designer is to know when to apply constraint — previously I hadn’t done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new typeface pairing will be reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://svbtle.com"&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt;. I mean no disrespect to Dustin, but rather the utmost &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; as a designer for what he achieved there. I like Proxima Nova as body text, and keeping Freight Sans for the headings looked nicer to me than Proxima Nova did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping the new typeface and type sizing are a bit easier on the eyes for everyone reading here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Stop designing perfectly</title>
    <published>2013-07-20T20:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-20T20:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/imperfect-design/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
	Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this mindset, we strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are we going about this all wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think we are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="school-marks"&gt;School marks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through elementary school, we’re taught that a mark of A is the ultimate standard to achieve. In our minds it’s 100%, because we can’t go any higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at highschool we learn that an A is actually part of a &lt;em&gt;range of percentages&lt;/em&gt;. Getting an A could mean anything from 80% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our “ultimate standard” is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, we realize that our ultimate standard is actually easier to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-standard-shifts"&gt;The standard shifts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shifting standard, where 80% to 100% is our top game, is a really good thing for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets us reevaluate what it means to achieve the top of our game, and remove the expectation of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of “marks” to judge our work, instead of just 100%?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-isnt-perfect"&gt;Design isn’t perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design doesn’t have to be perfect. The high standard that we want to achieve is possible without toiling forever to create that mythical 100% design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design that looks 80% right still gets an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can benefit us greatly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We stop spending too much time designing things;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our newfound time can be used talking with customers to find out what they think;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This feedback can be used to improve the design the way customers want it to be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time we’d have spent delaying our product’s launch to get a perfect design is much better spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t perfect. Don’t try to make it be. You’ll still get an A without getting 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep highschool marks in mind as you go forth to design the next “best”-looking product. Don’t try and be perfect right off the bat, give it time. An 80% is still an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing all your imperfect designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This article was inspired by &lt;a href="http://arleym.com/breaking-the-rules/"&gt;an article by Arley McBlain&lt;/a&gt;, where he mentioned that you can write less code and still have an element that looks 85% great. His stuff rocks, go read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnafish.ca"&gt;John Fish&lt;/a&gt;, a good friend of mine, wrote up &lt;a href="http://johnafish.ca/writing/perfection.html"&gt;a response to this piece&lt;/a&gt;. His take is interesting, though I’d like to point out that I never said making mistakes was okay. Go check it out, it provides a good differing perspective to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">WordCamp Atlanta: How to Make Six Figures in Web Design</title>
    <published>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/how-to-make-6-figures-in-web-design/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Atlanta 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdalman"&gt;James Dalman&lt;/a&gt; talked about how to build a profitable business on web design. &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JamesDalman/how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/04/21/james-dalman-how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design/"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many web workers don’t many any money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The key to making money is knowing how to run a business that provides for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business is about failures, not successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="focus-on-your-strengths"&gt;Focus on your strengths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find “what you’re made for,” and do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be a jack of all trades. Learn other skills, but don’t worry if you’re not good at them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This prevents you from being spread too thin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-your-confidence"&gt;Build your confidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, neither will clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident in what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do. For the things you’re not confident in, know people who are, and direct business their way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident. People notice. (James recounted stories about how he’s gotten business just by being confident, because people appreciate and are more comfortable with confidence.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="invest-in-relationships"&gt;Invest in relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building clients relationships is essential to business. It’s easier to keep an existing client happy than to find a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your clients. You want to ease their pain and make them happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t build relationships to get something out of it. That’s the wrong approach. Build authentic relationships, and let whatever happens happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A great way to build relationships is by attending meetups and conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="find-great-clients"&gt;Find great clients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. Believe that you’re good at what you do and that you can find great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great clients won’t balk at higher prices, because they understand the value you offer. This ties into being confident. Be confident that you can price high, because you have great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the best interests of clients in mind. They’ll appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to emails and phone calls can be a powerful tool! So many jobs can be missed just by not networking in these simple ways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communication might fall apart with clients. Overcommunicate to compensate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sell-true-value"&gt;Sell true value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell your work on its value, not by an hourly rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clients want to see the value and the benefits you offer, not how much you’re going to charge them every hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value can work better for you, because it can sometimes mean you make an enormous hourly rate, just because you were able to work fast. (The corollary is true, too, but be confident and it won’t matter.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value inspires you to work fast and not milk the clock, which results in good work done more quickly, which makes for happy clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="price-for-profit"&gt;Price for profit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you offer services, you want to make money for offering them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re freelancing, you want to make profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="do-awesome-work"&gt;Do awesome work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the best way to build your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go the extra mile and be the best you can in what you put out for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work can bring in even more business, because people recognize your talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open doors require effort to find. Opportunities don’t just come up, you need to put in the work to get them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Act on your ideas, or they’ll never get done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business isn’t about making the money. It’s about building awesome work and providing opportunities for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you spend a lot of time learning, that’s great. But you need to spend time acting on that learning, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: this is when the question period began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transition-to-selling-new-clients-on-value"&gt;Transition to selling new clients on value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guess the number of hours it’ll take you, pad it by a large margin, and then present the lump sum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain the value people need which you can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strike-a-balance-between-learning-and-doing"&gt;Strike a balance between learning and doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time can be very well spent on action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep reading what’s current.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend time building business connections in addition to learning and doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-and-quality-is-what-to-focus-on-when-finding-partners"&gt;Value and quality is what to focus on when finding partners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the quality in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t use microlancing sites to outsource. They devalue the industry on a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="for-small-tasks-after-launch-hourly-is-okay"&gt;For small tasks after launch, hourly is okay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t know how long it could take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, slap a small lump sum down that corresponds to your expected hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiny edits should be free. Don’t nickel and dime your clients, they’ll know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="need-resources-for-designers"&gt;Need resources for designers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step by step mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information about building businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="turning-down-clients-is-fine"&gt;Turning down clients is fine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do a project just for the money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can get locked into a painful project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow what your gut tells you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="networking"&gt;Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relationships take a long time to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing can be a good jumpstart to this process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cold-calling” can work sometimes, but often leads to rejection or bad clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partner with people who complement your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look around your network for good people. Hangout and befriend them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="payment"&gt;Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you partner with someone, have them in the process the whole time, but have the client pay them separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% down payment, once a project starts, no money back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put your terms in your invoice, your “contract” can be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take payment out of your system straight into your bank upon receiving it, to prevent people trying to take it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
