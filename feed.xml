WordCamp Toronto is coming up soon! This weekend, 400 people will descend upon Humber College's Lakeshore Campus in Toronto to engage in a few days of WordPress-driven fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org"&gt;WordCamp Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (WCTO) has done something a bit different than most WordCamps. WCTO has a bit of a history doing this, though. &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; they were one of the first WordCamps to try a split users/developers conference. While it was a huge success, the doubled organizational hassles were too much in the end, leaving us with a larger combined conference this year. Different for this year, though, is that the second day is composed entirely of panels and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the first day is packed with presentations (4 tracks in total), guaranteeing that all attendees will be able to get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking"&gt;Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting for me personally is that I’ll be speaking on Saturday! I’m very grateful to the organizing committee for accepting my application, and I’m looking forward to delivering my first ever conference talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking to users about how to hire a developer. This talk presents some interesting challenges, because the audience isn’t necessarily one I associate with as well as I do with developers. However, going out of my comfort zone is exciting for me, and I’m confident I’ll be able to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides for my talk along with a post-mortem will be put up sometime after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="meet-the-people"&gt;Meet the people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending conferences, setting goals is something I believe in doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; I’d wanted to champion discussions about WordPress’ potential role in education. That resulted in some really insightful results, and I’m sure I’ll bring it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I’d like to focus on in Toronto this weekend is getting to know the users. Too often, we as developers get caught up in our own little world and forget that it’s essential that we get to know the people we work for, both financially and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I’ll be &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/get-more-from-talks/"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt; and sitting in the front rows. These are the best ways to get results out of conferences, and I intend to employ them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-final-countdown"&gt;The final countdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend is approaching very quickly! WCTO is looking to be an excellent event, and I’m excited to see it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in attendance, make sure to give me a shout! I’m more than happy to have a chat at any time during the event. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or pick me out of the crowd, I look forward to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-info"&gt;
I met a boy on the bus today. He's 7 years old, in grade 2 at a local school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing he said to me was that he was, “[thankful] there’s no bees in the bus!” He went on to describe his life at school. He’s got two teachers (though he’s not sure why), and his favourite thing to do is recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then prompted me to explain that I’m 15 and in Grade 10 at a nearby highschool. (“Wow!”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conversation roamed wildly, as they’re apt to do when one of the participants is a little boy full of wonder. We went on to converse about a wide range of topics, from his love of playing games on his (passed-down) iPhone 4, to his recent trip to Legoland. (I didn’t know we had one. He told me the website and recommended I check it out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then told me that he only plays a few games on his iPhone, because his mom doesn’t make a lot of money and they can’t afford much. He says he looks forward to when he turns 10 or 11, so he can take up a paper route and make some extra money. Very young though he is, he’s already showing a passion and desire to go beyond what life’s given him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parted on good terms. I had to get off, and our conversation ran right up until that point. He gave me a high-five and then we went our own separate ways, me to wander home and he to continue on a life of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was &lt;a href="http://sayhi.ca/"&gt;Say Hi Day&lt;/a&gt;. The smallest things can make the biggest impacts. Get to know the people around you. Their stories will leave a lasting impression on your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s funny to look around at other people’s sites, because so often you’ll see spurts of activity followed by long periods of silence. It’s unfortunate because sometimes that content is really, really good, and you want to read more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, right before (or a while after) the content gap, there’s a post which explains the absence. Often the silence is attributed to something like a new job, or other commitments which take up the time that would normally be dedicated to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my post to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="working-hard"&gt;Working hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken on a new client. I’m now working for the Liberal Party of Canada, as a contracted web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun, new, exciting stuff that I’m happy to have a hand in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also thank &lt;a href="2013.montreal.wordcamp.org"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; for allowing this connection to happen. It was while I waited in line for the complimentary conference ice cream that I met the man who was nice enough to hire me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been great work so far, and I look forward to much more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking-words"&gt;Speaking words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more exciting news, my application to speak at &lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp Toronto 2013&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted. I’ll be providing a user oriented session, explaining how best to hire and work with a developer to see your idea to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s coming together nicely, and I’m so excited for the conference. It’s looking to be a great time, once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="studying-books"&gt;Studying books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer flew by, and now it’s time to return to my school and continue with my “day job.” I’m glad to be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="so-what-about-articles"&gt;So… what about articles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly proud of the work I put out over the summer. I can’t make any promises that I’ll put out work in the same quantity during this year. (I have a feeling I’ll maintain my high quality standards for essays, though.) It’s looking to be incredibly busy already, and it’ll only get busier as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there’s a few ideas I’ve got kickin’ around. I’m excited to see where this will all go.&lt;/p&gt;
