    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I met a boy on the bus today. He’s 7 years old, in grade 2 at a local school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing he said to me was that he was, “[thankful] there’s no bees in the bus!” He went on to describe his life at school. He’s got two teachers (though he’s not sure why), and his favourite thing to do is recess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then prompted me to explain that I’m 15 and in Grade 10 at a nearby highschool. (“Wow!”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conversation roamed wildly, as they’re apt to do when one of the participants is a little boy full of wonder. We went on to converse about a wide range of topics, from his love of playing games on his (passed-down) iPhone 4, to his recent trip to Legoland. (I didn’t know we had one. He told me the website and recommended I check it out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then told me that he only plays a few games on his iPhone, because his mom doesn’t make a lot of money and they can’t afford much. He says he looks forward to when he turns 10 or 11, so he can take up a paper route and make some extra money. Very young though he is, he’s already showing a passion and desire to go beyond what life’s given him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parted on good terms. I had to get off, and our conversation ran right up until that point. He gave me a high-five and then we went our own separate ways, me to wander home and he to continue on a life of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was &lt;a href="http://sayhi.ca/"&gt;Say Hi Day&lt;/a&gt;. The smallest things can make the biggest impacts. Get to know the people around you. Their stories will leave a lasting impression on your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s funny to look around at other people’s sites, because so often you’ll see spurts of activity followed by long periods of silence. It’s unfortunate because sometimes that content is really, really good, and you want to read more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, right before (or a while after) the content gap, there’s a post which explains the absence. Often the silence is attributed to something like a new job, or other commitments which take up the time that would normally be dedicated to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my post to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="working-hard"&gt;Working hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken on a new client. I’m now working for the Liberal Party of Canada, as a contracted web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun, new, exciting stuff that I’m happy to have a hand in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also thank &lt;a href="2013.montreal.wordcamp.org"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; for allowing this connection to happen. It was while I waited in line for the complimentary conference ice cream that I met the man who was nice enough to hire me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been great work so far, and I look forward to much more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking-words"&gt;Speaking words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more exciting news, my application to speak at &lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp Toronto 2013&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted. I’ll be providing a user oriented session, explaining how best to hire and work with a developer to see your idea to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s coming together nicely, and I’m so excited for the conference. It’s looking to be a great time, once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="studying-books"&gt;Studying books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer flew by, and now it’s time to return to my school and continue with my “day job.” I’m glad to be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="so-what-about-articles"&gt;So… what about articles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m incredibly proud of the work I put out over the summer. I can’t make any promises that I’ll put out work in the same quantity during this year. (I have a feeling I’ll maintain my high quality standards for essays, though.) It’s looking to be incredibly busy already, and it’ll only get busier as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there’s a few ideas I’ve got kickin’ around. I’m excited to see where this will all go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Constraints lead to great design</title>
    <published>2013-08-07T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-08-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/design-with-constraints/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/design-constraints-writing.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;Great art and, by extension, great design requires the artist to create constraints within which they do their work. They can then judge the strength of their resulting work by how well it satisfies these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constraints are good not just because they provide a method by which we can judge our work, but also because they can act as a framework upon which to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="without-constraints-we-do-not-know-what-problems-to-solve"&gt;Without constraints, we do not know what problems to solve.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential client has arrived, requesting that you “design [them] a website.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation alone is very hard to approach. There are countless different directions to take when designing a website, and designing one appropriate to the client’s needs is very difficult without further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As designers, it is our job to solve problems creatively. However, the complete lack of constraints given in this would-be scenario make it very difficult for us to know what problem it is that we need to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we need constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-is-the-question-to-get-us-our-first-constraint"&gt;“Why” is the question to get us our first constraint.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain these constraints, we must ask questions. We have to probe deeper, to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the client is looking for what it is they ask. Once we have the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; in hand, only then can we approach the &lt;em&gt;how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to our client and ask her &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she needs a website designed for her. Why is the strongest question word to use at this stage, because it allows us to hone in on the problem which is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon being asked why she wants a website designed for her, the client replies that she, “needs one for [her] established pet store.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, we appear to have received the constraint that will set us on our way to designing this lady’s website. We now know that we need to design a business website, as opposed to a personal or organizational one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could go on to design a website which shows all her store’s products as well as information about her business. Based off of the information we have thus far, that would be a reasonable approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, upon closer inspection we see that the answer provided here does not actually explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a website is needed at all! It provides to us &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; type of website she is looking for, but we still need more information before we can confidently craft this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-is-the-question-we-return-to-in-order-to-get-more-constraints"&gt;“Why” is the question we return to in order to get more constraints.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, “why” is the question word which will yield our next set of useful constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that we need to find out why her brick and mortar pet store requires a website, we return to our client to ask her just that. She responds that she, “wants to engage with [her] store’s loyal community of pet owners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. By asking this question, it is clear that the problem our client wants solved is very different from what we had initially suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of wanting a website which merely displays her catalogue, our client is looking for a way to take the store’s existing community online. This constraint provides for us an entirely different problem to solve, and we must create a different solution accordingly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="keep-asking-questions"&gt;Keep asking questions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by asking one more question, and getting one more constraint with which to design within, it has become quite clear to us the problem which our client has to have solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question-oriented approach, where we must ask questions in order to obtain constraints, is very effective at quickly bringing to light the underlying problem which our work must solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this process to narrow down with your client what it is they’re expecting you to create. By going through the simple steps upfront of asking questions, we can build a framework within which to create our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result? A happy client who walks away with a design that truly &lt;em&gt;solves their problem,&lt;/em&gt; instead of one which solves a problem their designer thought they had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lets-review"&gt;Let’s review.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a short review, here’s what you are going to do in your next pre-project meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that the key to good design is having constraints. These constraints let us design appropriately and judge effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask your client for the “why.” Why is it that they want a website?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to ask your client questions oriented around “why.” Ask until you’ve identified the specific problem they need solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these three simple steps, you’ll have a much clearer understanding of what your client needs you to create for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a canvas upon which to create. Go make art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;We should meet up on twitter, here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">When do your actions really matter?</title>
    <published>2013-08-03T15:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-08-03T15:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/it-always-matters/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you were in school, you were probably told countless times that, “This is when it really matters.” “This is when you have to start working hard, because it counts.” “These decisions will form the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, though, it always matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, “it” is your actions. How you carry yourself. How you interact with others. The decisions you make. It’s what you say and do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions always matter, because they carry through with you for the rest of your life. Inconsequential as some may seem, every decision you make is a part of you, shaping who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="shoddy-decisions"&gt;Shoddy decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re all prone to making some shoddy decisions at some point in our life. We can’t be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are those bad decisions a part of you, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. Even if the actions you took don’t directly influence you anymore, the mistake you made when making that decision should always remain a part of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learn-from-your-mistakes"&gt;Learn from your mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mistakes that make up who we are can be very useful learning tools. By keeping your mistakes in mind, you can form better decisions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look back on situations where you’ve made a bad decision in the past. Why did you make that decision? In future situations, what would you be better off doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="awesome-decisions"&gt;Awesome decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can all lay claim to a few awesome decisions in our lives. You know the ones I mean, the ones where you reaped serious benefits just because you made them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can learn from these great actions just like we can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="great-actions-are-repeatable"&gt;Great actions… are repeatable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can repeat your great actions. The things that brought you the most reward in your life are likely not actions that were entirely one-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re strategies, useful to keep in your back pocket for when you need a boost. Use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="it-always-matters"&gt;It always matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that, despite what was implied by your school teachers, it has always mattered. It always will matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you say and do make up who you are. Just by existing, you’re a public figure, and you need to shape that image of you who are into the person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that what you say and do will always matter. Keep that in mind as you go on to define a better you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;We should meet up on twitter, here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
