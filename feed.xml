    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
	Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this mindset, we strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are we going about this all wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think we are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="school-marks"&gt;School marks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through elementary school, we’re taught that a mark of A is the ultimate standard to achieve. In our minds it’s 100%, because we can’t go any higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at highschool we learn that an A is actually part of a &lt;em&gt;range of percentages&lt;/em&gt;. Getting an A could mean anything from 80% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our “ultimate standard” is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, we realize that our ultimate standard is actually easier to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-standard-shifts"&gt;The standard shifts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shifting standard, where 80% to 100% is our top game, is a really good thing for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets us reevaluate what it means to achieve the top of our game, and remove the expectation of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of “marks” to judge our work, instead of just 100%?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-isnt-perfect"&gt;Design isn’t perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design doesn’t have to be perfect. The high standard that we want to achieve is possible without toiling forever to create that mythical 100% design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design that looks 80% right still gets an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can benefit us greatly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We stop spending too much time designing things;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our newfound time can be used talking with customers to find out what they think;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This feedback can be used to improve the design the way customers want it to be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time we’d have spent delaying our product’s launch to get a perfect design is much better spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t perfect. Don’t try to make it be. You’ll still get an A without getting 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep highschool marks in mind as you go forth to design the next “best”-looking product. Don’t try and be perfect right off the bat, give it time. An 80% is still an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing all your imperfect designs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">WordCamp Atlanta: How to Make Six Figures in Web Design</title>
    <published>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/how-to-make-6-figures-in-web-design/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Atlanta 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdalman"&gt;James Dalman&lt;/a&gt; talked about how to build a profitable business on web design. &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JamesDalman/how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/04/21/james-dalman-how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design/"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many web workers don’t many any money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The key to making money is knowing how to run a business that provides for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business is about failures, not successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="focus-on-your-strengths"&gt;Focus on your strengths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find “what you’re made for,” and do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be a jack of all trades. Learn other skills, but don’t worry if you’re not good at them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This prevents you from being spread too thin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-your-confidence"&gt;Build your confidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, neither will clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident in what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do. For the things you’re not confident in, know people who are, and direct business their way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident. People notice. (James recounted stories about how he’s gotten business just by being confident, because people appreciate and are more comfortable with confidence.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="invest-in-relationships"&gt;Invest in relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building clients relationships is essential to business. It’s easier to keep an existing client happy than to find a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your clients. You want to ease their pain and make them happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t build relationships to get something out of it. That’s the wrong approach. Build authentic relationships, and let whatever happens happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A great way to build relationships is by attending meetups and conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="find-great-clients"&gt;Find great clients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. Believe that you’re good at what you do and that you can find great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great clients won’t balk at higher prices, because they understand the value you offer. This ties into being confident. Be confident that you can price high, because you have great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the best interests of clients in mind. They’ll appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to emails and phone calls can be a powerful tool! So many jobs can be missed just by not networking in these simple ways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communication might fall apart with clients. Overcommunicate to compensate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sell-true-value"&gt;Sell true value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell your work on its value, not by an hourly rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clients want to see the value and the benefits you offer, not how much you’re going to charge them every hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value can work better for you, because it can sometimes mean you make an enormous hourly rate, just because you were able to work fast. (The corollary is true, too, but be confident and it won’t matter.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value inspires you to work fast and not milk the clock, which results in good work done more quickly, which makes for happy clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="price-for-profit"&gt;Price for profit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you offer services, you want to make money for offering them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re freelancing, you want to make profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="do-awesome-work"&gt;Do awesome work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the best way to build your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go the extra mile and be the best you can in what you put out for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work can bring in even more business, because people recognize your talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open doors require effort to find. Opportunities don’t just come up, you need to put in the work to get them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Act on your ideas, or they’ll never get done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business isn’t about making the money. It’s about building awesome work and providing opportunities for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you spend a lot of time learning, that’s great. But you need to spend time acting on that learning, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: this is when the question period began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transition-to-selling-new-clients-on-value"&gt;Transition to selling new clients on value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guess the number of hours it’ll take you, pad it by a large margin, and then present the lump sum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain the value people need which you can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strike-a-balance-between-learning-and-doing"&gt;Strike a balance between learning and doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time can be very well spent on action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep reading what’s current.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend time building business connections in addition to learning and doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-and-quality-is-what-to-focus-on-when-finding-partners"&gt;Value and quality is what to focus on when finding partners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the quality in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t use microlancing sites to outsource. They devalue the industry on a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="for-small-tasks-after-launch-hourly-is-okay"&gt;For small tasks after launch, hourly is okay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t know how long it could take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, slap a small lump sum down that corresponds to your expected hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiny edits should be free. Don’t nickel and dime your clients, they’ll know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="need-resources-for-designers"&gt;Need resources for designers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step by step mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information about building businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="turning-down-clients-is-fine"&gt;Turning down clients is fine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do a project just for the money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can get locked into a painful project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow what your gut tells you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="networking"&gt;Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relationships take a long time to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing can be a good jumpstart to this process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cold-calling” can work sometimes, but often leads to rejection or bad clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partner with people who complement your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look around your network for good people. Hangout and befriend them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="payment"&gt;Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you partner with someone, have them in the process the whole time, but have the client pay them separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% down payment, once a project starts, no money back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put your terms in your invoice, your “contract” can be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take payment out of your system straight into your bank upon receiving it, to prevent people trying to take it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title type="html">Write in the Open</title>
    <published>2013-07-16T03:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-16T03:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/write-in-the-open/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
I do all my writing in the open. Anyone can view what I'm working on, the ugly drafts and the stupid ideas, at any time. This rocks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I write in the open? For those adventurous few who want to delve into my site’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, they can see all the writing I have. They can see the finished articles, the drafts, and the discarded but never deleted ideas. It’s all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-accountable"&gt;Be accountable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing in the open, I’m accountable. I know that someone could be reading my work long before it’s available, so I have to make it top-notch. Not only that, but I know that they could be looking at my work from months ago, which pushes me to make better content that outshines that writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can see that I have works which are still not published, and that I haven’t seen fit to delete it yet. I’m accountable to the people who see my writing sitting unpublished, because they know I have unfinished work. I don’t like having unfinished work, so it pushes me to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-transparent"&gt;Be transparent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing in the open, I can give sneak peeks. People see my work before it’s unpublished, and they get a chance to look at my process. They can see the work evolve by looking at the piece’s history. For example, I recently broke out a section of a larger essay I was writing into its own article, which ended up being my piece about &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/17hhiLk"&gt;my writing workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the veil like this allows people to see some of my thought process. They can watch the evolution of my thoughts and learn more about me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency is great, because it builds &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;. And having people who trust you is an awesome thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-bold"&gt;Be bold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead, put your unfinished work out there. Be bold, be confident. Don’t be afraid of what it might say about you. Do it often enough, and it’ll be a part of who you are, and people will come to respect and value you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing your unfinished work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Want to see &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; latest unfinished work? You can read my aforementioned &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/13qPwrn"&gt;essay on writing&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some thoughts on it, I’d love to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;hear them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">My writing workflow</title>
    <published>2013-07-15T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-15T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/my-writing-workflow/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
My writing workflow has evolved considerably over the past few years, going from zero in 2010, to where I am today. This evolution is largely due to the changing tools I use to publish and promote my writing, in addition to the type of writing I try to put out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the writing workflow I use, before diving into some of the issues with it and then considering what features of the process I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-workflow"&gt;The workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workflow is what brings me from initial idea conception to publishing. All pieces of writing I publish go through this process, or the majority of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An idea comes to me. This could be in the shower, on the bus, or late at night as I toss and turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write my idea down. The idea gets stored in whatever medium is convenient at the time, whether it’s my Moleskine that I carry around, or in Google Keep, or on the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I have time, I start fleshing out further thoughts around the idea. This usually manifests itself in random sentences which represent the core thoughts I wish to share.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, I’ll return to my ideas and start writing in a large notebook or typing my thoughts on my trusty &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_Series"&gt;Thinkpad T42&lt;/a&gt; (I use it almost exclusively for writing, because the keyboard is so damn good). This step is the one that often causes trouble for me, because the thoughts and inspiration surrounding me when I originally had the idea are no longer present, so I have much difficulty in writing my idea out in a way that befits my original passion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll then edit my writing, usually by passing it off to a friend and then reading it over myself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll publish the piece. Almost all my writing is published on this website, while I also decide to cross-publish some of the pieces on &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. This publishing step has a deceptive number of substeps if I’m publishing to my site, due to the way my publishing system is set up. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll start promoting the piece on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook, and by word of mouth (yep, that’s still a useful method in our online world).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process works okay (it’s resulting in this article, isn’t it?); but it doesn’t allow for some things which I consider very useful from writing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the issues with this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system isn’t very good at &lt;em&gt;sharing ideas&lt;/em&gt;. There’s no incentive for people to share, and there’s no built in large audience who will read my work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system doesn’t allow for actually writing and publishing the entire article from anywhere. I’m still tied down to using a computer with specialized software to publish my pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea can go cold. This ties into the previous point. Because I can’t write my entire article and then share it from anywhere, I’m limited in my “window of passion.” I have to make the most of very limited tools to write down my thoughts once I come upon an idea, and that often isn’t enough to craft a good piece of art before the idea disappears from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual publishing process (step 6) is a major pain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When I publish something, I have to first format the file in Markdown using a special header to provide the article metadata. Then, I have to commit it to git, and push it to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca"&gt;GitHub repo for this website&lt;/a&gt;. Then, I have to rebuild the site using nanoc, commit the results of that to git repo and push that repo to &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca-output"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, I have to SSH into my web server and &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; the repo back down from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, this is largely self-inflicted due to my insistence on using &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; to publish instead of a dynamic system like &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;; but it helps to illustrate the point that a good writing process, and thus a good writing system, should be easy to publish from.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pains are all either self-inflicted, or pains that exist with most publishing systems or writing workflows. They’re largely unavoidable, thanks to the nature of the tools available and what we expect to receive from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nice-bits"&gt;Nice bits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process does allow for a few niceties, though, which other systems do not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have control over the location of all my content, and can access it at any time. Because my content resides entirely in either: (a) sheets of paper in my notebooks, or (b) plaintext files on my computers, I control where it is. I don’t have to worry about exporting it from a company who may or may not allow that in the future… I already have it with me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have control over the presentation. Good ideas require good presentation to accompany them, in order to best &lt;em&gt;communicate&lt;/em&gt; them to their audience. Great ideas can be communicated via unstyled HTML just fine, but we’ve come to expect a higher quality from the information we read today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these points illustrate what I think is an important trait to value in writing systems — control. Important to me, my system allows the control of my writing to reside in my hands, and mine alone. Although I store my files on GitHub or on my web server, I still have complete copies of the git repositories on all my local machines, ready for the day I have to abandon those services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="in-short"&gt;In short&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My writing system is a bit janky, but it allows for me to, in a reasonable manner, come up with an idea, store it for later, revisit it and write it up, then publish it, without too much pain. Would it be easier if I moved parts of it to use a more dynamic publishing system, like WordPress? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s important to take away from this piece, though, is that what works for writing is what works for you. My system is far from perfect, or even ideal, and I will always be tweaking it to be better. However, it works for me in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after all, isn’t it true that all we want to do is share our ideas with the rest of the world? If your system can do that, I think it’s the right one for you.&lt;/p&gt;
