    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He battled with the mast, trying to keep it together so he wouldn’t be stranded. As he heard another crack, he paused before continuing his efforts. He thought about his life—about his friends, about his family, about his accomplishments. He realized that he was happy with his life. He had done all that he wished to do, there was no more for him. With that, he knew what he had to do. He quit his fight with a smile on his face, and let the sea swallow him along with his little craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His family began the ceremony with sniffles and tears. “We’re gathered here today to remember a man, a great man who was cruelly taken from us too soon.” The various audience members shook their heads in agreement, mourning what was, to them, a great tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The most horrifying aspect of this is that we lost him before he was ready to go. So much more of his life did he have to live with us, but a cruel force decided we were not to share in it with him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony continued, with audience members taking their turn at the podium to speak about their experience with him. The underlying theme to the words everyone spoke was that his life had been cut short, ended before he–and they–were ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife gave the closing words, “We can rest assured that he did not go down without a fight. I know my husband. As he was on his beloved ship, at no point did he consider giving up. Never did he stop trying to overcome the ocean, to get back to us. We can rest assured that he died trying to come back for us, for the life he loved so much.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Ice Cream Time</title>
    <published>2014-06-04T23:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a special time each night. I call it my “ice cream time”. It’s the period of time I spend each night dishing out, consuming, and appreciating my chocolate ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To others and, to be honest, to myself at times, this near dependency on frozen milk may appear detrimental to me. But I keep at it for more than just habit’s sake, and for more than just because of the chocolatey taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I persist with my ice cream time because of the grander opportunity it offers me for peace. When I’m eating that ice cream, I’m cut off entirely. I’m not tabbing, texting, or tweeting my way to anything that could distract me from that moment. For a person who struggles a lot with the implementation of mindfulness, that opportunity to cut off each night via ice cream is a delightful respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, we’re caught up in a culture which never wants to cut off. Our devices demand our attention, demanding we keep in touch with whomever is on the other side of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes we’re not even using these devices for active communication, choosing instead to use them passively: reading through your Twitter feed, your Facebook stream, or your inbox. We choose to cut ourselves out of whatever is directly at hand, being easily distracted and finding it hard to keep focused on what’s in front of us. Just now, while writing that sentence, I opened a new Facebook tab to check something based on a thought I’d had. Following through on that Facebook activity wouldn’t have generated any further benefit to my writing, the task at hand. Rather, it would’ve just sidetracked me and caused me to forget entirely what I was thinking about. We give up our ability to think and consider when we’re constantly switching what we’re doing. &lt;em&gt;Thinking takes time&lt;/em&gt;, contrary to whatever the makers of our devices and apps want us to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our devices demand efficiency of us. The corollary is also true; we demand efficiency of them. But our demands of efficiency are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demand our phones be quick at loading Facebook so that we can swiftly move on to checking Twitter. After we’ve processed the incremental updates that we’ve received there, we’ll move over to the one new email sitting in our inbox before heading back to Facebook to see what update from a friend is awaiting us. We demand speed from our devices so that we can quickly move on to the next task that they offer us, spending our time with them in a never-ending cycle which provides little appreciable long-term gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does it have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we demand efficiency of our devices for a different reason? Why can’t we demand quick services not to be able to consume many of them in less time, but to be able to consume a service and then &lt;em&gt;move on with our lives&lt;/em&gt;. And not the life tied up in those multiple devices of ours, but the life beyond them. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; life. Yes, I went there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives online are largely fabricated. There’s little disagreement when I assert that, when online, we put forth only our best face. The web is our ultimate bragging grounds, the place where we thump our chests only to perpetuate more chest thumping, and for little reason more. So if we’re spending time curating the best bits of our life for display online, can we actually refer to that as our &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; life? Sure, it’s a part of it, but it isn’t the one we truly experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond our own contributions to the web, consider what it is we’re most often doing here. &lt;em&gt;Passively taking in the activities of others.&lt;/em&gt; We’re not even taking in the curated version of ourselves, but of others! What value can we gain by only looking at the lives of others and comparing our own perspective, an uncensored version of ourselves, to their lives, heavily censored and curated versions of themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is valuable when we use it for active communication. Why don’t we use the web for what it makes sense for, to communicate with others to &lt;em&gt;get things done&lt;/em&gt;? It’s a waste of an amazing resource to do otherwise, a foolish waste of our own lives spent consuming those of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to wake up to the intention of our activities online. We need to be unafraid to cut ourselves off from the distracting, unfulfilling overconsumption made so convenient by the web. We need to focus on &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; lives, on our real lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those lives don’t live on the internet. They live outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some “ice cream time”. Take some time to focus on your life outside of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Distracting Notification Lights</title>
    <published>2014-05-29T21:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just turned off the notification light on my phone. It notified me in a way that caused me to be interrupted from what I was doing. It notified me in a way that took me out of my world and into its, one of incessant demands upon my attention which rarely amounted to much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I must choose to check when there’s something waiting for me in that world of distracting indulgences. It’s up to me to decide when it’s appropriate to stop what I’m doing and check on the world beyond my current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incessant throbbing of the notification light on our phones has become a symbol of the constant demands upon our attention which they so brilliantly exert. By choosing these devices as the ones that may “wake” us from the present moment, from the task at hand, we’re handing our ability to concentrate over to them, making hostages of our attention. Our attention is held hostage when that light’s off. Our attention waits until that light flashes. Then, as it begins its frequent, coloured flashing, our attention becomes enraptured by it, unable to be free until it’s addressed, until we deal with whatever message awaits us on our phone and we’ve forgotten what it was we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might protest that they can work while that light is flashing, but I’d put forth that they are probably just caught up in the unfortunate folly that is multitasking—caught between working on the likely-important task at hand and the equally-as-difficult task of ignoring that blinking light (or, as is more likely, trying to guess what message that light could possibly be hinting at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about the flashing light on phones, but the same could be said of vibrations, or even the “ping” of a new message sound. The flashing light is a particularly bad one, because of its incessant nature and cold, quiet background status. The others, at least, are a bit more intentional in their efforts to awaken us from our focus. That doesn’t make their efforts any more valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to start deciding when it’s appropriate to be interrupted and when it isn’t. When working, especially, we need to put aside whatever can interrupt us. But I think that the notification light is exerting its influence too far into our lives, as we let it interrupt everything from dinner discussions to reading sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present moment is &lt;em&gt;sacred&lt;/em&gt;. Fight your devices to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">New Year&amp;rsquo;s and Other Matters</title>
    <published>2013-12-31T16:00:01Z</published>
    <updated>2013-12-31T16:00:01Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/new-years-and-other-matters/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Articles about New Year’s resolutions are a dime a dozen this time of year. Generally speaking, I find the notion of New Year’s resolutions to be contrived—why are we choosing &lt;em&gt;this specific day&lt;/em&gt; to choose how we’d like to change ourselves within merely the confines of the coming year? There’s little appreciable gain to doing it this time of year, and yet society, as it so often does, moves as one to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the occasion of everyone else rushing to journal their resolutions for the coming year has given me cause to write up this little piece. It’s been a while since I wrote here, and as always I won’t promise that that will change any time soon. I’ve been spending a lot of time writing for myself lately, and the result of that is less writing which makes it to the eyes of the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you won’t find any New Year’s resolutions in this piece, I will point you in the direction of an essay I’m publishing alongside this article. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-hard-floor/"&gt;A Hard Floor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes a look at how to avoid the issue of complacency—a matter I consider very important, especially this time of year when we consider ourselves to be in a place wherein we are capable of changing ourselves. (As if that’s not possible any other time of year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it could be said that I’m making any New Year’s resolution, it’s that I wish to avoid complacency, as detailed in said piece. By bringing in a change of scenery and new surroundings when appropriate, I hope to avoid the inevitable stasis that complacency brings to all parts of life. I predict that I’ll be changing things up quite a lot in my life throughout the coming year, just as I’ve done this past one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have resolved to communicate better in the New Year, I’d love to get in touch—and stay that way! For communication in 140 characters or less (a limit which is both freeing and yet idea-crushing), you can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where I tweet far too many times a day. For online communication of a longer form, &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;emailing me&lt;/a&gt; will always work. (Though, be warned that with email it may take some time before I have the energy to give you an appropriately considered response.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I love online communication, I’m starting to see through its conveniences for its drawbacks. As such, I’m interested in starting up conversations via pen and paper—using letters, the old fashioned way. I’ve realized that this method has benefits which we overlooked when making the jump to digital methods, and I’d love to get in to regular correspondence with you. If that’s something that appeals to you, all it takes is reaching out to me via either &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; so that we can exchange addresses and get underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I despise the contrived change that people impose upon themselves this time of year, I recognize that it’s still a time of fun and happiness for all. I’m certainly feeling that way, and I hope you are, too. It’s a wonderful time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll close this little update with a quote from one of my favourite journalists. Let this be one of your references in this New Year of change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="block-quote"&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;Seek the truth, keep people honest, explore the world, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
