	&lt;blockquote&gt;When you call the cops, you participate in a regime of violence against poor and working class people of color in this city. It’s part of gentrification, it’s part of racism and it’s part of genocide. If we’re calling the police, we’re voting for that system—instead of putting time and effort into creating real and new responses to harm and engaging with the people around us in that process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go read &lt;a href="http://imaginealternatives.tumblr.com/post/487334687/feeling-for-the-edge-of-your-imagination-finding"&gt;the piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t familiar with the term “prison industrial complex” before reading this (and to be honest, I’ll have to read much more to really grasp it), but it’s reminding me of some past research I did into community/social justice initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the energy to write up more right now, but this is a topic I’d like to revisit in the future. If you’re stuck and want to do something about it &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; (which makes you a great human being), &lt;a href="http://www.cjiwr.com/"&gt;Community Justice Initiatives&lt;/a&gt; is an organization which makes great strides locally in this field. It’s the season of giving, &lt;a href="http://www.cjiwr.com/give-with-us.htm"&gt;throw a few bucks their way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s agree to be better human beings tomorrow than we were today. We can start that by listening to the voices around us a bit more. (And then a lot more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS—This may mark another turning point for this site, into more of a linkblog. I read a lot, and I’m growing increasingly weary of just tweeting out links to articles without any thoughts attached, or not even sharing the writing at all. Maybe this site will be the outlet, maybe something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Star Trek Future</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; paints a very nice vision of the future. It considers where we could be in a few hundred years. Its version of that future has us using our newfound spare time to take advantage of those core activities that have made us happy for so much of our history—reading, music, art. And when we’re not doing those things we’re most likely to be found spending time face-to-face with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the version of the future that’s playing out is a bit different. Reading, music, and art are all fading a little bit in terms of participation—we consume with great pleasure, but there’s little by way of creation on the part of the everyday person. And when we spend time “together”, we’re more often than not not actually together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like some more of that &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; vision of the future. Doing the things we’ve loved forever. Being with people in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and all the spaceships and such would be pretty great, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Vinyl, Consideration, and Crap</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like listening to vinyl records. I used to espouse their listening benefits—a “better sound quality” and “more warmth”—but I’ve since stopped that. Now, when I think of vinyl, some different characteristics come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinyl is, first and foremost, a physical medium. The physical nature of records reminds us that their existence in our lives should be considered—they’re not to pile up like meaningless clutter. The way we play a record is also part of its greatness; you’re meant to listen to it from start to finish. This method enforces the idea that we should enjoy the work in its entirety, as opposed to chopping it up and skipping around. It’s like a movie: you’re not supposed to parse it scene-by-scene; it’s the whole that compels you to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two characteristics of records make me think about how we consider things today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we mindful of what we let into our lives? Whether physical or otherwise, do we consider the place a new object in our life has, or do we just let in new things willy-nilly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when we create these objects for the world, are we creating with the entire picture in mind? Do we create with the intent for an object to be whole, or do we create with the intent for an object to be chopped up and dissected into various parts which, even when brought together, are weaker than the whole?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that we do. I don’t know that we’re applying careful consideration to the new in our lives. I don’t know that we think beyond the immediate nature of our creations. I think we should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no good to blindly create without a sense of considered purpose. Why bother, if what we’re adding doesn’t really mean anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the answer. I do know that people do it. I certainly do. But maybe there’s value to stopping and thinking about it all a little more. To &lt;em&gt;considering&lt;/em&gt; what and, more importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re working the way we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives are already full of crap. We should consider if it’s worth it to add any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to my mom and dad, without whom I doubt I’d have much experience with the joys of vinyl. Thanks especially to my dad for teaching me how to use our 80s turntable, and to both of them for their combined efforts during their youth to gather together a mass of wonderful albums which have remained in their possession to this day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In light of recent events, all I want to say is this: we control what news we take in about the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can either seek out the bad things, those which weigh heavily on us, or we can seek out the good things, those little joys which remind us that there’s more to life than just tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t stop things outside of our control. We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; affect what we see and hear about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2014-07-11T02:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as a fighter in a war. It’s a war against an evil both insidious and pervasive. I like to think of myself as a fighter in a war against the unpleasantness of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re to continue this war metaphor, I’ll need to describe some of the battles I’m fighting. There are many of them, against many enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, my battle is against the unpleasantness of ugliness. I fight then for beauty, trying to win in a series of confrontations the aim of which is an eradication of my enemy, ugliness, or whatever is contrary to beauty, using the tools of design to bring delight back into a world which is so ready to accept unsightliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At other times, my battle is against the unpleasantness of bad manners. Then, I fight to be polite in the face of a rude enemy who refuses to afford the same respect to me as I to them. The goal here is to spread a little niceness in the world, if possible, by wielding it as a weapon with which I attack those who would prefer to be rough and raw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much of the time, my battle involves the notions of equality and inequality. This is a battle where I sometimes catch myself fighting for the wrong side. It’s unintentional when I do this, but I do it nonetheless. See, where the other two battles involve something of an obvious enemy which can be fought with obvious tactics, this battle has an enemy which is not easily discovered, and it’s fought with tactics equally as opaque. It’s a battle where I struggle sometimes to even know what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; it is I’m fighting for, one where it’s hard to know how to approach a situation because the way is very much unclear. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to recognize that a situation is even part of this battle, it being all to easy to categorize it as something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first two wars are easily fought. They’re easy wars to fight, because they’re loud and highly visible. But the third war—the war for equality—it’s nowhere near as visible or as comprehensible. Like a diamond, it has many, many facets. But in a way distinctly unlike that gem, there is no clear way through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no good to be content fighting just the first two wars, though. The third war, if I’m realistic, is the only one that’s truly insidious. The outcome of that war—if there can even be a declared outcome—is more important than that of any other war I can fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can I fight it? How can I fight it when I don’t know how to fight accurately—when I don’t have direction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This war needs generals. It needs clear leaders who can unite the factions fighting for equality—for there are many, but they are fractured and disparate—and guide us all towards the end we all know is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those leaders may already exist. Whoever they are, we need to find a way to start following them.&lt;/p&gt;
