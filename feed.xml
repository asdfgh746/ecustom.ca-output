    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my &lt;a href="/articles/thursdays/"&gt;life-and-writing recap&lt;/a&gt; last week that I’ve been publishing something new here each Thursday for the past five (now six!) weeks, which is a marked improvement over my previous record of spotty postings over the course of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping to a publishing schedule has been interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it’s encouraged me to have a steady stream of words flowing from me. Here’s a look at my &lt;a href="https://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt; writing stats for the past two weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/draft-word-count.png" alt="Chart depicting a words-per-day count ranging from 250–3200 over a two week period." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I expect myself to put something up on Thursday encourages me to write down thoughts and expand them into coherent pieces whenever I can. This has led me to view writing as something which can (and must) be practiced, and to, well, practice it. The weekly publishing has encouraged that practice in a very effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, though, I kind of worry about the quality it promotes. If I’m expecting myself to publish every week, am I expecting something great every week? Well, no. Not anymore, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I thought it essential that anything and everything published here was of the highest quality. Then I realized I couldn’t really measure that, that whenever I published a “greater” piece, the rest would then become of the not-highest quality. It was about this time that I realized that this quality comes naturally with time, through the aforementioned practice of writing. (Although there’s still a lot of not-great writing produced after tons of practice. It’s the same as with any skill.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final benefit I’d like to bring up with regards to this regular posting is that it encourages—or, in some cases, forces—me to publish old drafts that I’ve edited (or at least written completely) which might otherwise languish, unread, never being seen by the eyes of anyone but myself. That’s a sad fate for any writing, I think; writing demands to be read. I’m increasingly of the opinion that it’s worth it to publish your old stuff which you still agree with. It’s good for the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping to a regular writing schedule is important. It helps you practice what can be a really difficult skill to work at. Equally important, though, is to actually publish whatever you’re writing. Even if it feels like it’s shit to you, it’s probably worth publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps just one person or makes them think about something different, there’s all the worth you’ve ever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like Thursdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re a delightful, safe day of the week. They’re also the day I get a lot of my writing done. I find them to be a great day for this—by the time I’m writing on Thursday, about four days worth of “out-and-about” experiences will have accumulated, giving me plenty to think and write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Thursdays aren’t just my writing day. They’ve become my publishing day. (I don’t write and then publish same-day. Some editing is always in order.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Thursday for the past few weeks, I’ve been publishing something here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by talking about the &lt;a href="/articles/notification-lights/"&gt;notification light on my phone&lt;/a&gt; and how I’ve shut it off, so that I can focus on the task at hand and be “in the moment” more often. Since then, I’ve disabled notifications on my phone &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that I’m no longer unintentionally interrupted from what I’m doing—at least as far as my phone is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar theme, I shared a story about &lt;a href="/articles/ice-cream-time/"&gt;my ice cream time&lt;/a&gt;, which I set aside each night in order to get a moment of peace from the unfortunate busyness of technology. I also talked a bit about the idea of efficiency and how tech should be efficient not to get more done, but to give us more time to live life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departing from my regular style a bit, I published a (very) &lt;a href="/articles/on-struggling-and-death/"&gt;short story about death&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the idea that there’s always multiple sides to consider in an issue, and that we can’t presume to know how another feels about a situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I published a &lt;a href="/articles/passion-not-pressure/"&gt;defense of procrastination&lt;/a&gt;, wherein I conveniently redefined procrastination to mean that I’m waiting for an impassioned moment to strike, enabling me to put out something great under a seemingly restricted schedule. There, I also talked about creative restraints, something &lt;a href="/articles/design-with-constraints/"&gt;I’ve discussed before&lt;/a&gt;, and how they can enable us in those desperate final moments to produce when all other methods seem to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wrote &lt;a href="/articles/edit-your-own-voice/"&gt;a bit about editing&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of learning about your own voice and how you like to verbalize your ideas. There’s no better way to learn about what you like or dislike than by seeing it in someone else’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to keep this regular publishing up. We’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I’ve just given a little summary of my writing over the past few weeks, I may as well throw in a look at how things in my life have been going. This is to cover the past few months, because it’s been &lt;a href="/articles/september-2013/"&gt;a while since I’ve done this last&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friend who I know, or person who wants to be my friend but I don’t know (in which case, &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#119;&amp;#115;&amp;#107;&amp;#105;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;), or person who is on a deep internet dive and has chanced across my work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished another year of school and realized that my educational passion is for the liberal arts and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for two friends, Sonja Katanic and Emma Cohen, I did the web design and some editing for their online magazine, &lt;a href="http://plasmadolphin.com/"&gt;Plasma Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;. The adjectives I’ve heard used to describe it include “rad”, “wicked”, and “funky” (okay, that last one was me), and I encourage you to check it out. This project for me has been (and will continue to be) an exercise in patience and last-minute productivity as I race to meet deadlines, but I love those friends and I love Plasma. Publication work is fun. I enjoy it to no end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke at WordCamp Ottawa in May. I talked (again) about &lt;a href="http://2014.ottawa.wordcamp.org/sessions/#post-850416"&gt;how to work with developers&lt;/a&gt;, a talk which I tweaked and love but have now semi-retired. (You can check out &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lchski/be-the-perfect-client-round-2"&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt;, if you wish.) Being in Ottawa for the conference reminded me yet again why I love that city so much. There’s a feeling to it that I haven’t gotten in many other places—something to do with it being the nation’s capital city, I think. Capital cities are always special places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking again at the work side of things, I’ve been keeping a fairly low profile of steady work. Right now I’m working on an exciting project with a local real estate group, which is enabling me to play with WordPress in ways I never have before. An article (or talk) will probably come out of that in the future; it’s an ideal candidate for a case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of the future? Well, I’m taking on an interesting role this summer in addition to being a designer: I’ll be building actual physical things! In this case, an addition to my house. Maybe this’ll finally give me something of an appreciation for what “tools” &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; are, and what “craftsmen” &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; do. I’ll also be at &lt;a href="http://2014.montreal.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; come August. Not as a speaker, but as an enthusiastic attendee once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m doing more and more with my life, but I’m feeling less and less of the tiredness that plagued me over the past few months. There are plenty of possible reasons for that fatigue, but I’m not up to consider them at the moment—I just want to take advantage of this energy and do things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect more writing. I say that with a confidence that I’ve not had for a while about publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s stay in touch, yes? &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#119;&amp;#115;&amp;#107;&amp;#105;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; are both great. If you’d rather write letters (which are awesome), reach out to me on one of those platforms and we’ll exchange addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This update has been a refreshing departure from my regular writings here. But I don’t expect them to be too common—there’s far too many other things to write about than my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Edit, not write, to find your own voice</title>
    <published>2014-06-26T16:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2014-06-26T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/edit-your-own-voice/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing comes difficult, I’ve often found editing to be a productive method to use to get me focused again and to enable a return to vocalizing ideas. To this end, I’ve got something of a standing offer with friends to edit whatever writing of theirs they’d like me to—no charge, no reciprocation necessary, just me taking in pieces and polishing them up a bit.&lt;sup id="fnref:editing-offer"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:editing-offer" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Doing this has made me realize the power of an individual’s voice in writing and just how it can affect the opinion being presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking in these pieces from friends, I encounter a lot of different voices and writing styles. One of my friends whose pieces I frequently edit has a very expressive, flowery style, while another has a more fact-driven, logical approach. Both styles allow the author to argue a point effectively, but what makes one author distinct from another is the style they choose to employ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really understand what I’m going to get at concerning writing styles, we’ve got to look at the Modernist philosophical movement. Though there’s a lot more to the movement than just what I’m referencing, Modernism was an attempt by artists (authors being the relevant sort here) to forward their messages in ways both direct and indirect. We see this really clearly with the (crazy excellent) writing of James Joyce, who helped popularize the idea that not only is the story of a novel important, the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;, but also the way in which that story is told, the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; of the writing. One of my favourite examples of this is found in Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&lt;/em&gt;. The writing in that book gets more convoluted and complicated whenever the main character, Stephen, is grappling with difficult ideas or trying to understand the significance of something in a big way. When Stephen’s having an easier go of life, though, the writing itself eases up and the language becomes far simpler to understand. Joyce was employing both the plot and his surrounding style in order to press on his readers the real message which he intended. (It’s no coincidence that Joyce’s work has an &lt;a href="http://www.utulsa.edu/jjq/"&gt;entire quarterly journal&lt;/a&gt;, published regularly since 1963, dedicated to analysing it, because this extra level of complexity made the interpretations of Joyce’s works far more numerous!) Modernism was an attempt to use artistic mediums—in this case, language—to say something about the works they were used to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to my two friends and their styles, I find editing to be an educational experience, forcing me to walk the fine line between deleting their personal style—which tells readers about their message in an important way supplementary to the content itself—and refining it into a more cohesive whole. Assuming that these folks are at all conscious about how they’re writing (which I know them to be), it’s fair to say that the way they write is intentional. It’s important, then, to try to preserve that style as best as possible while preventing it from detracting from the message itself. With the flowery friend, I sometimes think a toning-down is appropriate to keep the message clear, while with my logical friend I sometimes suggest a bit more fire for their words to reflect the passion which I know they possess in their heart. This kind of editing is most reliably achieved when the editor and the edited know each other well enough that the editor can gather what it is the edited really means to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all this editing, I’ve realized something important about the nature of writing and words, something which Joyce and his Modernist friends grasped and carried out so effectively: it is just as much about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you say things as it is &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dry, academic tone on the most interesting subject will still manage to make that subject feel dry and boring. On the other hand, an over-zealous approach can also turn readers away, making them uncomfortable. Clear, concise, impassioned reasoning will always win out over either of the two, because it appeals both to people’s desire for knowledge and their desire to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what that voice or style feels like to you, the best way to figure that out is to actually edit things yourself! Trying to discover it by writing can be a futile process, because you’re more likely than not to get stuck and bogged down writing with the same old voice you’ve always used. Through editing you might find that that voice doesn’t present the right version of you and your thoughts that you intend it to—seeing the “mistakes” in others’ writing is far easier than in your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing that leads to figuring out that voice is being honest and respectful in your writing. Those two things, when combined in a considered manner (considered meaning that respectful doesn’t require you to always be nice, but that you should always be appropriate), lend an air of genuineness to your writing. If &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you say your message is just as important as &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you’re saying, then I reckon being genuine is a pretty good way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit a ton. Realize that your writing may not be saying at all what you mean it to. Edit your own words to bring it there, and then bring in others who really know you to help you along further. Asking for help is one of the most genuine things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

    <title type="html">Work under Passion, Not Pressure</title>
    <published>2014-06-20T00:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t like doing things without being inspired or inclined to do them. To do so rarely leads to very good results. When doing so I have to force creativity and inspiration, which inevitably leads to a forced-feeling final product. The best solution I’ve found to this is to never force work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day, I’ll have a multitude of projects on the go, whether academic, professional, or personal. However, I find I work best on these when I don’t work on them actively. Instead, I tend to go about my day without working on them, filling it at times with mindless routine and at others with activities meant to activate, stimulate, and challenge my brain. These activities aren’t specifically chosen to result in inspiration for any one of my projects in particular. Rather, I’m trusting my brain (which I judge to be most capable) to be able to make the necessary connections between whatever I’m doing and whatever needs to be done. I’m trusting my brain to draw inspiration from my observations of my environment.  I’m trusting my brain to generate the passion required for great work. Therefore, unless I’m already stricken with the required inspiration and passion to work, I don’t. Instead, I, quite simply, live life. Inevitably as I’m living life, an idea strikes and then I’ll choose one of my ongoing projects to use as an outlet for my response to said idea. This is when real, creative, fruitful work gets done, as opposed to work that’s forced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style of work often annoys others. They question how I’m so sure that a fitting idea will come along in time for me to complete the project by its deadline. The truth is that I’m not sure at all. My method has worked pretty well thus far, and I’ve little worry that it will stop doing so in the future. If that happens, it’ll probably mean that I’ve stopped exercising my brain, in which case I have bigger problems than getting my work done. However, in the event that I’m ever pressed for time and an idea just isn’t coming, I’ve got a solution: impose creative restraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative restraints are great. They’re like the walls of a sandbox. We could play with all the sand and all the shovels on an entire beach, or we could force ourselves to build something awesome using only the sand and tools found within its walls. When we limit the field from which we draw our ideas, it gets a lot easier to find one that works. If you’re pressed for time, then, the answer is simple. Bring down the number of things you can create in that time by employing some creative restraints. Build some walls and forget about whatever’s outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re observant, you may notice that what I’m essentially advocating for—or, perhaps, defending—in this piece is procrastination. I want to say that I don’t advocate mindless waiting, or mindless procrastination. I’m arguing for &lt;em&gt;purposeful&lt;/em&gt; procrastination. I’m arguing for time well spent. I’m arguing for a better quality final product. I believe in waiting for inspiration to come along, spurred on by my own activities. I believe in working because I have the perfect idea to finish one of my projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I don’t believe in working under pressure. That leads to ugly, forced work. I believe in working under passion. That always leads to great results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He battled with the mast, trying to keep it together so he wouldn’t be stranded. As he heard another crack, he paused before continuing his efforts. He thought about his life—about his friends, about his family, about his accomplishments. He realized that he was happy with his life. He had done all that he wished to do, there was no more for him. With that, he knew what he had to do. He quit his fight with a smile on his face, and let the sea swallow him along with his little craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His family began the ceremony with sniffles and tears. “We’re gathered here today to remember a man, a great man who was cruelly taken from us too soon.” The various audience members shook their heads in agreement, mourning what was, to them, a great tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The most horrifying aspect of this is that we lost him before he was ready to go. So much more of his life did he have to live with us, but a cruel force decided we were not to share in it with him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony continued, with audience members taking their turn at the podium to speak about their experience with him. The underlying theme to the words everyone spoke was that his life had been cut short, ended before he–and they–were ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife gave the closing words, “We can rest assured that he did not go down without a fight. I know my husband. As he was on his beloved ship, at no point did he consider giving up. Never did he stop trying to overcome the ocean, to get back to us. We can rest assured that he died trying to come back for us, for the life he loved so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
