    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just overheard a segment on my local news station about parking around schools. Parents were complaining that they have to arrive “twenty minutes before school” to find a parking spot to drop off their children, and that people often have to resort to double parking or blocking driveways even with their early arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inanity of this situation is enormous. Why is it necessary for parents to drop their children off at school? Aren’t schools situated in neighbourhoods such that kids are either close enough to walk, or receive busing? Certainly, that’s how school boards justify their busing distances: students living within a certain range deemed walkable for their age don’t receive busing, while those who live further do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that children who live far enough from the school to walk should receive busing, it follows that the ones who are being dropped off at school in the mornings live within the “walkable” boundaries for the school. (Either that, or their parents insist on driving them even if they could ride the bus, which is ridiculous.) The solution to all these parents jostling for parking spots in the morning seems obvious, then: the kids should be walking to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions to the effect that children might walk anyplace on their own quickly raise cries of opposition, people who argue that the world is too dangerous for kids to walk unaccompanied. Of course, this is hyper-sensationalized BS. But, it holds sway over our public consciousness. One only needs to look at the recent case of the Meitivs, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/maryland-couple-want-free-range-kids-but-not-all-do/2015/01/14/d406c0be-9c0f-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html"&gt;Maryland parents who are being investigated for neglect after letting their children walk the one mile home from a nearby park&lt;/a&gt;, to see just how little independence our society tolerates in our kids. Or, just how little faith we have in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all brings to mind &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/"&gt;Hanna Rosin’s excellent piece about the death of childhood independence&lt;/a&gt;, which provides support for all the claims that the world is becoming safer and safer, while we continue to tell ourselves that it’s more and more dangerous. She goes on to explain the detrimental effects of this delusion upon childhood development, arguing that the loss of opportunities for fostering independence in kids is a major one which must be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories like the one on the news tonight frustrate me, because they remind me of just how far we’ve gone in our hyper-sensationalized culture of fear. The parents in the news story are driving their kids to school twenty minutes early just so they can secure a parking spot while doing so. Twenty minutes is a good amount of time: even at the slow walking pace of three kilometres per hour, that allows a kid to cover one kilometre—approximately the busing threshold for elementary and middle school age children. Kids could walk to school in that time and arrive in time for class, allowing morning schedules at home to be shifted later to allow for more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if parents won’t overlook the ridiculousness of their refusal to allow kids to walk (and choose to deny them the independence that such solo walking habits could breed), nothing is preventing them from doing the walk with the kids themselves! Driving the kids to school does nothing but breed laziness and inactivity in the children, and it further enforces the use of a transportation type which we desperately need to use less of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If parents cry out that they’re too busy to do the walk with their kids, and that they thus rely on the car as the only reasonable alternative, they ought to get together with other parents in their area and see about alternating walking supervision for a larger group of local kids. Or they could even consider allowing the large group to walk together, unsupervised—there’s safety in numbers, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solutions to this silly parking problem exist, and they’re not in the form of better parking lots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this all relies on the basic assumption that we can look past our natural culture of fear. It also assumes that we can trust our local community, rising above our perceived individual superiority and putting a little faith in those around us. Though there is a clear way, there seems to be very little will.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t tweet. It’s not worth the risk. Don’t make phone calls. You’re being recorded. Don’t send emails. Sooner or later, we’ll all be reading them. Don’t take naked selfies, because some freak will find a way into your phone and share your photos in the seediest corners of the Internet. And the rest of us will have to look. Again, it’s not you. It’s us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s digital, it’s public. That should make you scared of losing your privacy. But I’m more concerned about it scaring you away from publishing or sharing your thoughts and opinions at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing was fun at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;blockquote&gt;When you call the cops, you participate in a regime of violence against poor and working class people of color in this city. It’s part of gentrification, it’s part of racism and it’s part of genocide. If we’re calling the police, we’re voting for that system—instead of putting time and effort into creating real and new responses to harm and engaging with the people around us in that process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go read &lt;a href="http://imaginealternatives.tumblr.com/post/487334687/feeling-for-the-edge-of-your-imagination-finding"&gt;the piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t familiar with the term “prison industrial complex” before reading this (and to be honest, I’ll have to read much more to really grasp it), but it’s reminding me of some past research I did into community/social justice initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the energy to write up more right now, but this is a topic I’d like to revisit in the future. If you’re stuck and want to do something about it &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; (which makes you a great human being), &lt;a href="http://www.cjiwr.com/"&gt;Community Justice Initiatives&lt;/a&gt; is an organization which makes great strides locally in this field. It’s the season of giving, &lt;a href="http://www.cjiwr.com/give-with-us.htm"&gt;throw a few bucks their way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s agree to be better human beings tomorrow than we were today. We can start that by listening to the voices around us a bit more. (And then a lot more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS—This may mark another turning point for this site, into more of a linkblog. I read a lot, and I’m growing increasingly weary of just tweeting out links to articles without any thoughts attached, or not even sharing the writing at all. Maybe this site will be the outlet, maybe something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Star Trek Future</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; paints a very nice vision of the future. It considers where we could be in a few hundred years. Its version of that future has us using our newfound spare time to take advantage of those core activities that have made us happy for so much of our history—reading, music, art. And when we’re not doing those things we’re most likely to be found spending time face-to-face with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the version of the future that’s playing out is a bit different. Reading, music, and art are all fading a little bit in terms of participation—we consume with great pleasure, but there’s little by way of creation on the part of the everyday person. And when we spend time “together”, we’re more often than not not actually together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like some more of that &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; vision of the future. Doing the things we’ve loved forever. Being with people in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and all the spaceships and such would be pretty great, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2014-07-25T02:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like listening to vinyl records. I used to espouse their listening benefits—a “better sound quality” and “more warmth”—but I’ve since stopped that. Now, when I think of vinyl, some different characteristics come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinyl is, first and foremost, a physical medium. The physical nature of records reminds us that their existence in our lives should be considered—they’re not to pile up like meaningless clutter. The way we play a record is also part of its greatness; you’re meant to listen to it from start to finish. This method enforces the idea that we should enjoy the work in its entirety, as opposed to chopping it up and skipping around. It’s like a movie: you’re not supposed to parse it scene-by-scene; it’s the whole that compels you to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two characteristics of records make me think about how we consider things today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we mindful of what we let into our lives? Whether physical or otherwise, do we consider the place a new object in our life has, or do we just let in new things willy-nilly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when we create these objects for the world, are we creating with the entire picture in mind? Do we create with the intent for an object to be whole, or do we create with the intent for an object to be chopped up and dissected into various parts which, even when brought together, are weaker than the whole?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that we do. I don’t know that we’re applying careful consideration to the new in our lives. I don’t know that we think beyond the immediate nature of our creations. I think we should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no good to blindly create without a sense of considered purpose. Why bother, if what we’re adding doesn’t really mean anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the answer. I do know that people do it. I certainly do. But maybe there’s value to stopping and thinking about it all a little more. To &lt;em&gt;considering&lt;/em&gt; what and, more importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re working the way we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives are already full of crap. We should consider if it’s worth it to add any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to my mom and dad, without whom I doubt I’d have much experience with the joys of vinyl. Thanks especially to my dad for teaching me how to use our 80s turntable, and to both of them for their combined efforts during their youth to gather together a mass of wonderful albums which have remained in their possession to this day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
