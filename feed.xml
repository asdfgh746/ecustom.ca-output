    <title type="html">A Lack of Comments</title>
    <published>2013-07-07T00:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;Comments are viewed as being an essential part of any website delivering primarily written content, such as this one. So why is this site devoid of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of comments has always been a concious choice of mine — this site was never meant to have any. However, it was called to my attention in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardmtl/status/353190233967296512"&gt;Tweet by Richard Archambault&lt;/a&gt; the other day that I haven’t yet explained myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of comments is attributable to two factors: implementation, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t use a truly dynamic publishing system like WordPress to create my website. The tool I use, &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;, is designed for the creation of static-file websites, which don’t lend themselves particularly well to comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no plans to change away from nanoc for the moment, so that option isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might say. Why don’t you use a third-party hosted comment solution like &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against Disqus in particular, but I do take issue with having too many external dependencies, as well as not having control over the appearance of all my site’s components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Disqus (or any similar hosted comments service) forces me to load the necessary scripts from their servers (which I try to limit how often I do), as well as to use the styles they provide. Unfortunately, none of the styles they offer fit in with the message I try to send with this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside about losing centralized comments is that it’s difficult to see all the different reactions that have occurred. However, my strategy to combat that is simple: update the article in question with links to the external commentary, with a response of my own. (This whole post is really an example of that, thanks again to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardmtl"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I could have comments on the site in a technical manner which I agree with, I’m not sure I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="philosophy"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s really stopped me from including comments. I don’t believe it’s necessary to have comments on personal sites anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion around posts will still happen (does still happen). However it occurs on other mediums. I receive comments via Twitter, via Facebook, via email, and I feel that the ones I receive there matter more than if I had received them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are contacting me using those methods, it usually means that they actually have something of substance to say about what I wrote. What they say over Facebook or Twitter is more public than what they say here, so they’re more likely to put out high quality content, if they put anything out at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for high quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-door-is-still-open"&gt;The Door is (Still) Open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omitting comments doesn’t mean I’ve closed the door to discussion on my pieces of writing. It just means I’ve decided to move that discussion elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A Talk a Day</title>
    <published>2013-07-06T02:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-06T02:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-talk-a-day/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;With a rather empty summer schedule, I've put some plans in place to make the most of it, by watching a talk a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer will be the least scheduled I’ve ever had; because my family isn’t traveling for any major vacations and I’m only volunteering for two weeks, I’ll have lots of spare time to myself. I know that if I don’t fill that spare time with something useful, I’ll wither intellectually… So I’ve put together my “talk a day” plan to keep myself engaged through the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a great intellectual kickoff to my summer with my attendance at &lt;a href="/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013"&gt;WordCamp Montréal 2013&lt;/a&gt;, where I heard lots of great talks and came away with plenty of notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for ways to keep myself learning, I realized that one of the best ways to do so this summer would be to continue listening and taking notes on talks. Fortunately for me (and the WordPress community at large), just about every talk that occurs at WordCamps are recorded and uploaded to &lt;a href="http://wordpress.tv"&gt;WordPress.tv&lt;/a&gt;. This is the perfect resource to use to “attend” plenty of talks that you’d have no opportunity to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various WordPress-specific talks available from WordPress.tv, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers"&gt;Google Developers&lt;/a&gt; puts up video of just about every session they’ve ever hosted. Special gems are the feature talks from Google I/O, which are always worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are various other random talks which I’ll chance upon to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-goal"&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to watch (on average) a talk a day. I’m also taking notes as I watch these talks, as I would if I were actually in the room. This has the added benefit of improving my handwriting, which is something I’ve always been a bit ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a pretty sustainable goal, given the time I have. I’ve been trying it out the past few days and I’ve had no trouble setting aside an hour before bed to watch a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you to try and join me in reaching this goal. I understand the extra time I have is a bit of a luxury, but watching the interesting talks which suit your tastes during your spare time will go a long way towards furthering your knowledge and keeping your mind sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-sharing"&gt;The Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to writing out my notes during the talk by hand, I also want to take the time (when I can) to type up my notes for the talks and publish them here. The parsing of unstructured notes into more structured versions for digital publishing will help me to learn the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this can help provide a good accompaniment to the slide decks usually published by these authors, for those who don’t have the time or means to watch the videos, but are able to read my notes and view the slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-talks"&gt;The Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this intellectual journey with WordCamp Montréal 2013. You can view the talks I attended &lt;a href="/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013/#talks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks I want to watch are a large cross section, covering the various aspects of digital publishing. From design to development to content creation, I’m interested in the full gamut. While my skills don’t lie in all those areas, I feel I’ll be better equipped to handle the tasks set before me if I’m well-versed in the various aspects facing digital publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watching presenters from such a variety of fields covering such a variety of topics will prepare me better for my eventual speaking endeavours. I’m applying to speak at &lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in October, as well as WordCamp Montréal next summer, plus some other events in between. I’ll be much more prepared to handle these situations if I have more exposure to the different styles present at WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of any great talks that I’ve missed, please let me know using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or, if you prefer, by &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for the great collection of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks I’ve watched after that are as follows (I’ll keep this list updated as I go):&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">After WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al 2013</title>
    <published>2013-07-03T18:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-03T18:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
	This was my &lt;a href="/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;second WordCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and it will definitely not be my last. WordCamp Montréal (WCMTL) fulfilled all &lt;a href="/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"&gt;my expectations&lt;/a&gt; and went beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around I decided to loosen up a bit more than I did previously, and did my best to meet people and get to know about what they did. Needless to say, that resulted in a far more interesting experience for me than when I focused on the talks exclusively, as I did when I attended WCTO: Developers. (See &lt;a href="#talks"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for the talks I attended.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of people to meet at WCMTL, and there was rarely a time when I felt I had nobody to speak with. Everyone there was very open and accepting, and I think everyone went in with the mindset of meeting people, which worked well for everyone present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed talking with some of the various organizers of the event: Shannon, Kirk, Carl, Richard (didn’t get to meet Richard), and Jeremy, all of whom were great people who were clearly capable of putting on a great event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, meeting people such as Yannick Lefebvre, Dion Hulse, and Brian Levine who all gave great advice and encouragement about their field was much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many more people whom I got the chance to speak with at the event that I couldn’t list here. Rest assured that the people who attended WCMTL were top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="education"&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending, I published that I wanted to discuss how WordPress could be used in education, to teach digital publishing; but also to teach web development and “how to code.” To this end, I had discussions with many people about the potential for WordPress to fill that role, including Al Davis, who heads up education at &lt;a href="http://www.wpuniversity.com/"&gt;WPUniversity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many unique perspectives about the issue, including some which ran contrary to what I was pushing for. That’s perfectly acceptable, and I appreciated the different outlooks on what coding issue should be like in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re at a time where WordPress has the potential to be really disruptive in coding education. I’d like to help instigate that push, so expect to hear more from me on that topic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordCamp Montréal was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of the organizers, speakers, volunteers, and the help of the sponsors, it was an awesome event, a great way to mark its 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to come back next year if schedules allow, and I’ll hopefully be able to ramp up the number of WordCamps I attend in the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved these talk links to the bottom, because the sea of blue was rather ugly. I’ll be posting my notes on all of them in time, but here are the links to the slide decks and presenter Twitter accounts. In chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Before WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al 2013</title>
    <published>2013-06-26T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-06-26T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al is fast approaching, and I'm looking forward to what I'm sure will be a fantastic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve attended only &lt;a href="/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;one other WordCamp before&lt;/a&gt;, not being fortunate enough to join in on the good fun in &lt;a href="http://2013.ottawa.wordcamp.org/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wordcamphamilton.com/"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;; however it was a great experience which I’m sure will be replicated (or surpassed!) by Montréal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks that have been lined-up for this event are looking good. An interesting trend is the move towards development talks that feature more and more heavily into performance, studying and optimising for it. &lt;a href="http://digitalize.ca/"&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt; will be talking about caching, while &lt;a href="http://www.taylorlovett.com/"&gt;Taylor Lovett&lt;/a&gt; will be talking about looking at WordPress from a Computer Science perspective — a new one for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to be sitting in on some content strategy and writing talks. Given my move towards a more generalized approach when working with clients, the additional knowledge will be useful (plus, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KO_DavidH"&gt;David Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; will be presenting on the subject and I’ve wanted the chance to hear one of his talks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://ma.tt"&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; will be holding an open floor question session to end the event, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who are attending WCMTL are looking to be a fine bunch, as is to be expected! There will be people of all types attending, some who I’ve met before, some who I’ve seen in the distance before, and some who I’ve only ever seen online. Of course, there will be many more I’ve never seen, and I hope to connect with them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going off my experience at WCTO, I know there will be great opportunities to connect with people through the event. I’m expecting to (though holding out hope that I won’t) be the youngest person at the event, which is always an interesting position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope to connect with some of the people I’ve interacted with a little over Twitter in the last few months, and hopefully get a few minutes to chat with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wordpress-and-education"&gt;WordPress and Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the things I hope to take away from WCMTL, I really want to hear people’s thoughts on a subject which has been nagging at me lately: How can we better use WordPress as a platform to teach web development (or coding, or programming, or …) skills in schools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is great potential for the WordPress project to fill a role where it provides clear ways for students to apply themselves in an educational setting and learn more about web development as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is already WordPress being applied in an educational setting; but it acts more as a communications tool than a development teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from experience, the current state of “web design/development” education in schools (at least what I’ve seen) is pitiful. Using Dreamweaver to create table-based layouts with garish colours is hardly what I’d deem to be employable skills (or even skills which inspire students to learn more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There needs to be a movement away from this, and I think WordPress could be a part of that. Taking people and offering them real problems (in the context of WordPress) for them to solve could lead to some innovative solutions and some great future coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting we create classes centred around contributing to core, because education goals could conflict with the goals of core and the workflow surrounding core contribution; but I think there needs to be some way for educators to have their students learn using WordPress, as opposed to dated technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="looking-forward-to-the-weekend"&gt;Looking Forward to the Weekend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m definitely looking forward to what will happen this weekend. I’m prepared (kind of, not packed at all) to see a great collection of talks and to meet the many people who will be attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there will be an avenue by which to have some good discussion about education and WordPress, in addition to all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll be at WordCamp Montréal this weekend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;send me a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll make sure to meet up with you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;Technology has the ability to do great things, as has been demonstrated numerous times throughout history. It has revolutionized industries, created new ones, and spelled the demise of others. Today, however, we are using technology to evolve industries; building upon the foundations of an industry, and re-imagining how work can be done within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the stacks of pen and paper in retail, instead being replaced by the mouse and keyboard. The inefficiencies of the hospital waiting room are being improved by always-on access to patient records, making sure people with pressing issues are admitted first. And in education, perhaps the most important, students are being engaged in learning through new methods, using technologies such as the Internet to access information, instead of paper textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three industries (retail, medical, and education) are being affected very strongly by technology today, and the effects of technology run deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="retail-industry"&gt;Retail Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retail industry has evolved significantly in recent years, notably since the advent of computers. “Retail” was at its core the same industry in 1900 as it was in 1750—inefficient and often slow. People did not have access to the same goods that people take for granted today, perhaps because there was no easy method of managing distribution and buying or selling. However, when retail industry members realized how to properly implement computer systems in their business model, things began to change drastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stock-levels-they-are-a-changin"&gt;Stock Levels, They Are a-Changin’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when stock had to be recorded in paper books and kept in storage. Instead, all store managers have to do now is to input how much stock has been sold, and how much arrived, and their computers can manage knowledge of the store’s stock levels. When stock of a certain item begins to run low, the system notifies the manager to buy more of that item. Advanced systems can run all of this automatically, from the buying of stock to when it is sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some systems, whenever stock is shipped to a certain store, that store is notified of what will be arriving when, so they can anticipate stock levels. The moment an item is bought from the store, the stock levels are adjusted accordingly. When stock of a certain item begins to run low, the store automatically notifies the supplier that it needs more of it, and has it bought and shipped to them. This allows for retail managers to relieve themselves of the duties of administering to stock levels, instead allowing them to focus on interacting with customers or improving the store experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="talk-talk-talkin-to-the-guy-next-door"&gt;Talk, Talk, Talkin’ to The Guy Next Door&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements have been made in other areas of retail, such as communication. Whereas previously communications organizing the sale of components to manufacturers down the supply chain might have been completed through letters or face-to-face meetings, the computer (more specifically the Internet) allows these meetings to happen from anywhere in the world. Video chatting technologies such as Skype allow members of a meeting to see and hear each other, making communications more clear than if they were conducted through letter. This also allows for much faster and cheaper completion of negotiations, as they can be completed with less correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-great-day-for-storage"&gt;A Great Day for Storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage of information has also been affected hugely by computers. The density at which we are storing information has increased dramatically over the years, meaning the amount of space needed to store a piece of information has decreased. In the past, information was recorded on paper and stored in a room somewhere, taking up space. A letter written on standard letter paper would take up the amount of space of that piece of paper, which could become difficult to manage if there was lots of letters being stored. However, with modern storage technologies implemented through the computer, that letter can be stored in far, far, far less physical space than if it was in its physical copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard drives on which computers store information generally have a size of 3.5in, but can store up to 4TB of information on them. To put that in perspective, a letter written in standard letter format, a full page in length takes up approximately 25KB of space, which is a miniscule portion of the capacity of modern hard drives. This allows for far more storage in less space, saving costs for the people needing that storage. Another advantage is brought on by these new storage methods: it takes far less time to find the file or record one is searching for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously people would have to search through boxes of paper records to find the information they needed, but now all they have to do is sit down at a computer and search for the file they are looking for, and they can find it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing information on hard drives does not come without its share of issues. As paper is at risk of catching fire, so too are hard drives, but they have other issues as well. For example, hard drives can and almost always will fail after time, risking the loss of data stored on that hard drives. For that reason hard drives can be easily backed up, all the files copied to another drive, which makes the data much safer. This is an advantage hard drives have over storage methods used in the past, when backing up paper documents involved copying them out again, often by hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="medical-industry"&gt;Medical Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical industry has evolved in ways that could previously only be wished for. Using computers, hospitals are able to maintain a database of patient records, allowing them to organize waiting room times according to highest priority. These records can be shared between hospitals, ensuring an enriched experience offered to patients wherever they go. Computers also allow medical staff to consult with one another with more ease; if a nurse does not know how to deal with a certain issue, they can call up a doctor and have a video conversation so that the doctor can explain with actions and gestures how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient records being available any time and nearly instantly allows for far greater accuracy when completing procedures or diagnosing a patient. For example, if a patient has previous experience getting stung by bees, and has not developed a rash before, but is now suffering a reaction to being stung, doctors and nurses might use this information to help with their diagnosis of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this notion of a database of patient records, there are also databases for medical professionals consisting of knowledge about diseases, medications and their side effects, as well as how to treat certain illnesses or injuries. These allow doctors and nurses to collaborate far more effectively, and can increase the quality of treatment given to a patient. This also allows for medical professionals to not have to learn as much in their education because they will have access to it in a database of treatments once they are in the workforce. This can obviously lead to a decline in the knowledge of practitioners, which is dangerous given how vital they are to the continued well being of the human race. Granted, it is highly unlikely that medical practitioners will simply stop being taught the ins and outs of their craft, to be replaced by a database, but for more obscure treatments they may turn to these exterior information sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, all of a sudden, the medical databases were shut off, and doctors no longer knew how to treat certain cancers or other illnesses? Given, they may have the correct medication, but would they necessarily know the correct ways to administer it to gain maximum affect from its contents? This could be very dangerous if practitioners begin leaning on these external sources of information too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also emerging in medicine online check up methods for less serious illnesses. This may save patients from having to make a trip to the emergency room for something that is not a true emergency. They might instead book a time with their family doctor or general practitioner who can provide the same service the hospital could provide, but without having to go through the emergency room waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has certainly allowed the medical industry to improve and streamline its operations, but is it at the expense of being able to rest assured that a doctor knows how to treat a certain illness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="education-industry"&gt;Education Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education industry is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of technology into classrooms. When the personal computer debuted, innovative educators saw an opportunity to aid and propel student learning using this groundbreaking device, and those who could afford computers bought them for their class. Of course, micro circuitry also allowed for calculators, far more affordable than a personal computer, and more specialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers introduced calculators into their math classes, which allowed students to compute the result of an equation far faster than if they had been using the traditional pen and paper methods. As a result, students began to rely less and less on the traditional methods, instead turning to the calculator which was highly convenient. Teaching practices had to shift as well, to fit with this new paradigm of student learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students began to use different methods to complete their work, teachers had to change as well. No longer was rote memorization as important as emphasized before, as now students could quickly access the information from a variety of different sources, instead of having to think it through. The teacher was not able to as easily control the information fed to children, as the Internet exposed them to a seemingly limitless barrage of it. Therefore, teachers began teaching students better ways to research, better ways to sift through the information they found to find what was of quality. Synthesizing ideas from this information instead of recalling facts was used as a tool to help students understand what they were learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the computer impacted students’ experiences at school in other ways as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, when students had assignments they needed to hand in, it was necessary for them to write them up by hand. Now, students need merely to have access to a computer and a printer to “write up” their assignments, and it is not uncommon to find that a teacher requires the assignment be typed. This led to the fall of teaching handwriting (cursive) in schools, because it was no longer relevant. Why teach a student how to write neatly when in the future all of their work will revolve around typing, which will create perfect looking text for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, teachers became able to teach their students in more ways, as well as being able to support the learning needs of particular students better. When previously a science class may learn entirely from textbooks, now teachers can direct students to use a greater variety of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great improvement to education brought about by modern technologies is that of online learning. Students can take courses taught anywhere in the world from any other place provided they have a connection to the Internet. This can lead to detrimental side effects, however, such as the student not having as great a connection with the teacher or not being able to express themselves through online communications. Words only convey approximately 7% of the message being sent, with tone making up 38% and nonverbal cues making up the other 55%. This shows a weakness of the increasing usage of technology in the classroom, wherein students interact less with their teachers and may not be able to learn to their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology is used more and more within classrooms, it is shifting not only the methods with which teachers teach and students learn, but also the mindsets of students. If one can quickly compute the answer to a math problem using a calculator, why bother with writing it out on paper? This may lead to laziness over time, as well as other detrimental side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, technology being introduced in classrooms is beneficial, but it is important at the same time that teachers teach the “old” methods of learning so that students do not become too reliant on their technology. A generation of students who rely entirely on their calculators to compute math problems would be problematic indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-words"&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of modern technology into our industries is a gift that should not be taken for granted. Being freed from the methods of the past for the methods of the present allows us to reevaluate how we do business and improve the lives of consumers everywhere, as well as those in need of healthcare or education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as modern technology continues to be integrated with our industries, it is important that those integrating the technology consider the potential implications down the line when the technology may not be available. It is of the utmost importance that we do not become so dependent on the technology that when it is not there for us we cannot survive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="notes-on-this-piece"&gt;Notes on this Piece&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This piece was part of a project written for school in my 2011-2012 school year. It’s a bit rough around the edges, but I’m publishing it to lead into future discussions on the evolution of society due to technology, and the resulting effects of that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I also published this piece on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/p/c9b8629f1e99"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, where I will cross-publish future pieces in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
