    <title type="html">When do your actions really matter?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you were in school, you were probably told countless times that, “This is when it really matters.” “This is when you have to start working hard, because it counts.” “These decisions will form the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, though, it always matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, “it” is your actions. How you carry yourself. How you interact with others. The decisions you make. It’s what you say and do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions always matter, because they carry through with you for the rest of your life. Inconsequential as some may seem, every decision you make is a part of you, shaping who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="shoddy-decisions"&gt;Shoddy decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re all prone to making some shoddy decisions at some point in our life. We can’t be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are those bad decisions a part of you, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. Even if the actions you took don’t directly influence you anymore, the mistake you made when making that decision should always remain a part of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learn-from-your-mistakes"&gt;Learn from your mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mistakes that make up who we are can be very useful learning tools. By keeping your mistakes in mind, you can form better decisions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look back on situations where you’ve made a bad decision in the past. Why did you make that decision? In future situations, what would you be better off doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="awesome-decisions"&gt;Awesome decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can all lay claim to a few awesome decisions in our lives. You know the ones I mean, the ones where you reaped serious benefits just because you made them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can learn from these great actions just like we can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="great-actions-are-repeatable"&gt;Great actions… are repeatable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can repeat your great actions. The things that brought you the most reward in your life are likely not actions that were entirely one-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re strategies, useful to keep in your back pocket for when you need a boost. Use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="it-always-matters"&gt;It always matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that, despite what was implied by your school teachers, it has always mattered. It always will matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you say and do make up who you are. Just by existing, you’re a public figure, and you need to shape that image of you who are into the person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that what you say and do will always matter. Keep that in mind as you go on to define a better you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;We should meet up on twitter, here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Stop listing features. Start gaining customers.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don’t list features for your online product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t care that much about the fact that your service integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, Drive, and your refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t care about how your service works. They do care about how it will help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-greeks"&gt;The Greeks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look back around two and a half thousand years to see why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle wrote about &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pathos.&lt;/em&gt; Logos is about appealing to logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you list features, you’re appealing to their sense of logic. You’re having them use logic to understand how your product will work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you’re trying to convince someone to do something – whether that’s to sign up for a mailing list, to sign up for a free trial, or to register an account with your service – it’s far better to appeal to their &lt;em&gt;pathos,&lt;/em&gt; or their sense of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re creatures of emotion. Because we’re like this, we’re naturally attracted to those things which appeal to our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can your product appeal to your potential users’ emotions instead of just their logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="explain-what-it-does-for-your-users-instead-of-how-its-done"&gt;Explain what it does for your users… instead of how it’s done.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your product page has a list of features like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, and Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autosaves your work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has keyboard shortcuts for editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list of features appeals to logic pretty well. It’s very clear how the product works. However, it doesn’t really appeal to your users’ emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewrite this feature list to better explain what the product can do for your users, and why it’s useful for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, and Drive. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Access your work wherever you are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autosaves your work. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Never worry about changes to your work being lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has keyboard shortcuts for editing. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Cut down on time and be more efficient with your editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how our three new list items do a much better job of explaining to a potential user how your product can help them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now appealing to the emotional side of your users… a much more powerful pull than just logic alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="not-just-for-product-pages"&gt;Not just for product pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to working with clients, too. Don’t sell your client on the fact that you’ll create a “WordPress site” for them. Usually, they won’t know about the technology, and they won’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do care about the fact that the website you provide them will do the job they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this applies to just about any situation where the goal is to convince someone. You want to appeal to the emotional side of the person you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appealing to emotions is much more powerful because they have such strong effects on us. Harness the power of emotions when you explain the benefits of what your service does. Harness the power of emotions when you explain why you’re the best freelancer for the job. Harness the power of emotions when you need people to listen to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop listing features. Start explaining what you can do for your users, and start gaining customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Want some help moving away from feature lists? I’d love to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;help you out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Run your business like a school</title>
    <published>2013-07-27T19:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from education systems. They’ve worked for years to find organizational structures that work for them, and we can improve our businesses a lot by modelling ourselves after their proven models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common school models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “integrated” approach, where students from kindergarten to grade 8 are all in the same building.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “dedicated” approach, where the entire school is composed of students in grade 7 and 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each has their own benefits and downfalls. Your business will be better off if you adopt the first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="put-everyone-together-and-watch-progress-happen"&gt;Put everyone together and watch progress happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated approach is awesome for business. Think of each specialty in your team as a different grade. Depending on your business, you might have designers, developers, and copywriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all these talents into close proximity with one another. This lets them work with each other, finding partners who complement their skills so that they can build awesome products together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage passive collaboration like this. It allows skills to come together which might not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-culture-by-encouraging-mingling"&gt;Build culture by encouraging mingling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive collaboration works great, but there comes a time when you need to encourage members of your team to get to know each other on non-work terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this in the schools with “reading buddy” programs, where older grades go read with the younger grades. This is forced mingling, and it helps to build a sense of community by forcing people to meet who may not have otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this community is essential. It becomes the lifeblood of your organization, your company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a good company culture, so encourage its growth by encouraging people to get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting you go right now and tell two people on your team to start reading to each other. Provide venues through which your team gets together and can get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be as simple as your whole team having lunch together (and not talking about work), or as elaborate as a one week retreat to a sunny destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the mingling style that works for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-a-facilitator"&gt;Be a facilitator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers in integrated schools are facilitators. They provide the place for different people to come together, and then they step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do a great service to your business by providing that space for people to come together, both in a working context and in a casual context. Your business should have a work/life balance, and you want the opportunities you afford your team to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring everybody together, both for work and for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For work, you want to put all your skills in one place. There’s little point in separating out these skills, because that creates walled gardens where you have complex processes to communicate between “departments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walled gardens are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For life, you want all your awesome people to get to know each other. Provide opportunities for them to befriend one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, who doesn’t prefer working with friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work hard to bring about these changes within your organization. Run it like a school, and enjoy the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A change of typeface</title>
    <published>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/change-of-face/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve changed the typeface used for the main body copy on this site. It was &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro"&gt;Freight Text Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m now using &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova"&gt;Proxima Nova&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freight Text wasn’t doing it for me anymore. Firstly, it wasn’t rendering very nicely for me. Secondly, I wanted to change away from a serif face. We’re used to reading sans-serif on the web by now, I don’t see a need here for a serif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with changing the typeface, I also decreased the overall type size. It was far too in your face previously. One of the skills of a designer is to know when to apply constraint — previously I hadn’t done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new typeface pairing will be reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://svbtle.com"&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt;. I mean no disrespect to Dustin, but rather the utmost &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; as a designer for what he achieved there. I like Proxima Nova as body text, and keeping Freight Sans for the headings looked nicer to me than Proxima Nova did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping the new typeface and type sizing are a bit easier on the eyes for everyone reading here.&lt;/p&gt;
