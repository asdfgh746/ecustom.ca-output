    <title type="html">Distracting Notification Lights</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just turned off the notification light on my phone. It notified me in a way that caused me to be interrupted from what I was doing. It notified me in a way that took me out of my world and into its, one of incessant demands upon my attention which rarely amounted to much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I must choose to check when there’s something waiting for me in that world of distracting indulgences. It’s up to me to decide when it’s appropriate to stop what I’m doing and check on the world beyond my current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incessant throbbing of the notification light on our phones has become a symbol of the constant demands upon our attention which they so brilliantly exert. By choosing these devices as the ones that may “wake” us from the present moment, from the task at hand, we’re handing our ability to concentrate over to them, making hostages of our attention. Our attention is held hostage when that light’s off. Our attention waits until that light flashes. Then, as it begins its frequent, coloured flashing, our attention becomes enraptured by it, unable to be free until it’s addressed, until we deal with whatever message awaits us on our phone and we’ve forgotten what it was we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might protest that they can work while that light is flashing, but I’d put forth that they are probably just caught up in the unfortunate folly that is multitasking—caught between working on the likely-important task at hand and the equally-as-difficult task of ignoring that blinking light (or, as is more likely, trying to guess what message that light could possibly be hinting at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about the flashing light on phones, but the same could be said of vibrations, or even the “ping” of a new message sound. The flashing light is a particularly bad one, because of its incessant nature and cold, quiet background status. The others, at least, are a bit more intentional in their efforts to awaken us from our focus. That doesn’t make their efforts any more valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to start deciding when it’s appropriate to be interrupted and when it isn’t. When working, especially, we need to put aside whatever can interrupt us. But I think that the notification light is exerting its influence too far into our lives, as we let it interrupt everything from dinner discussions to reading sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present moment is &lt;em&gt;sacred&lt;/em&gt;. Fight your devices to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">New Year&amp;rsquo;s and Other Matters</title>
    <published>2013-12-31T16:00:01Z</published>
    <updated>2013-12-31T16:00:01Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/new-years-and-other-matters/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Articles about New Year’s resolutions are a dime a dozen this time of year. Generally speaking, I find the notion of New Year’s resolutions to be contrived—why are we choosing &lt;em&gt;this specific day&lt;/em&gt; to choose how we’d like to change ourselves within merely the confines of the coming year? There’s little appreciable gain to doing it this time of year, and yet society, as it so often does, moves as one to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the occasion of everyone else rushing to journal their resolutions for the coming year has given me cause to write up this little piece. It’s been a while since I wrote here, and as always I won’t promise that that will change any time soon. I’ve been spending a lot of time writing for myself lately, and the result of that is less writing which makes it to the eyes of the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you won’t find any New Year’s resolutions in this piece, I will point you in the direction of an essay I’m publishing alongside this article. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-hard-floor/"&gt;A Hard Floor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes a look at how to avoid the issue of complacency—a matter I consider very important, especially this time of year when we consider ourselves to be in a place wherein we are capable of changing ourselves. (As if that’s not possible any other time of year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it could be said that I’m making any New Year’s resolution, it’s that I wish to avoid complacency, as detailed in said piece. By bringing in a change of scenery and new surroundings when appropriate, I hope to avoid the inevitable stasis that complacency brings to all parts of life. I predict that I’ll be changing things up quite a lot in my life throughout the coming year, just as I’ve done this past one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have resolved to communicate better in the New Year, I’d love to get in touch—and stay that way! For communication in 140 characters or less (a limit which is both freeing and yet idea-crushing), you can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where I tweet far too many times a day. For online communication of a longer form, &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;emailing me&lt;/a&gt; will always work. (Though, be warned that with email it may take some time before I have the energy to give you an appropriately considered response.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I love online communication, I’m starting to see through its conveniences for its drawbacks. As such, I’m interested in starting up conversations via pen and paper—using letters, the old fashioned way. I’ve realized that this method has benefits which we overlooked when making the jump to digital methods, and I’d love to get in to regular correspondence with you. If that’s something that appeals to you, all it takes is reaching out to me via either &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; so that we can exchange addresses and get underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I despise the contrived change that people impose upon themselves this time of year, I recognize that it’s still a time of fun and happiness for all. I’m certainly feeling that way, and I hope you are, too. It’s a wonderful time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll close this little update with a quote from one of my favourite journalists. Let this be one of your references in this New Year of change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="block-quote"&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;Seek the truth, keep people honest, explore the world, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title type="html">A Hard Floor</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One night, I ate my daily dose of chocolate ice cream while sitting on the hardwood floor outside my room. I did this because I’m not allowed to eat in my room. I’d grown tired of my other ice cream eating spots—my living room, my dining room—neither of these held any appeal to me that night. Eating downstairs was out of the question, too; I’d just discovered a great playlist and wanted to be near my speakers so that I could really hear it. So, I sat on the floor outside my room. It was a nice change of scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor was hard, cold, unwelcoming. It was probably the least comfortable spot I could’ve been in to eat my ice cream that night. Even by bringing a chair into the hall, I would have had far more comfortable accommodations by which to eat my ice cream and listen to the great playlist. But I insisted on that hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting there on the floor—my head rested against a closet door, my legs stretched through an open doorway—the contrast of my situation struck me. There I was, in a spot of intentional discomfort. But, even as I was in a spot that my body didn’t particularly enjoy, my mind was very content—happy, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my favourite treat in hand and the music I enjoy most coursing through my ears, I was taken away from my present, actual situation. I was taken instead to a place where my mind was free to focus and think about the things I cared for. By imposing discomfort upon myself instead of accepting the comfort offered and suggested by others, I’d overcome the great beast of complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complacency is a risky affair. Comfort—in whatever form it manifests itself for each individual—is the cause of complacency. But the causes of comfort, too, cannot be ignored: laziness, acceptance, and outside pressures. We can’t let ourselves grow comfortable, for when we do, we sacrifice our ability to engage our minds with new stimuli, with new considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid comfort, we have to overcome its causes. We must remain active. We must be curious, constantly searching for a truer answer. And we can’t cave in to outside pressures. Surpassing the limits imposed by these causes is the way to avoid comfort—the way to embrace discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to engage our discomfort in order to stave off complacency. The complacent are easily overcome, overlooked, and, ultimately, replaced. In order to avoid those unfortunate fates, we have to act now. We have to change the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find your change of scenery. Mine was the discomfort provided by the hard floor outside my room. Yours may be something less, or potentially something far greater. Whatever it is, reach for it when you start to feel the claws of complacency grabbing at you. The change can be temporary, or it could be permanent. It wasn’t one night more before I returned to my other ice cream eating spots. But the key is that I went elsewhere, to refresh my mind and to allow it to take in new considerations. Chances are, even if you return to your old spots after the change, you’ll view them through a newfound perspective. Such perspectives rarely do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you have to do, do it. Wherever you have to go, go there. And when should you do it? Whenever complacency begins grabbing at you. Chances are that that’s the case right now. It’s time for a change of scenery. It’s time for you to find your own hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the new view.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Before WordCamp Toronto 2013</title>
    <published>2013-10-02T21:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-10-02T21:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-toronto-2013/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
WordCamp Toronto is coming up soon! This weekend, 400 people will descend upon Humber College's Lakeshore Campus in Toronto to engage in a few days of WordPress-driven fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org"&gt;WordCamp Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (WCTO) has done something a bit different than most WordCamps. WCTO has a bit of a history doing this, though. &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; they were one of the first WordCamps to try a split users/developers conference. While it was a huge success, the doubled organizational hassles were too much in the end, leaving us with a larger combined conference this year. Different for this year, though, is that the second day is composed entirely of panels and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the first day is packed with presentations (4 tracks in total), guaranteeing that all attendees will be able to get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="speaking"&gt;Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting for me personally is that I’ll be speaking on Saturday! I’m very grateful to the organizing committee for accepting my application, and I’m looking forward to delivering my first ever conference talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking to users about how to hire a developer. This talk presents some interesting challenges, because the audience isn’t necessarily one I associate with as well as I do with developers. However, going out of my comfort zone is exciting for me, and I’m confident I’ll be able to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides for my talk along with a post-mortem will be put up sometime after the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="meet-the-people"&gt;Meet the people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending conferences, setting goals is something I believe in doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"&gt;WordCamp Montréal&lt;/a&gt; I’d wanted to champion discussions about WordPress’ potential role in education. That resulted in some really insightful results, and I’m sure I’ll bring it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what I’d like to focus on in Toronto this weekend is getting to know the users. Too often, we as developers get caught up in our own little world and forget that it’s essential that we get to know the people we work for, both financially and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I’ll be &lt;a href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/get-more-from-talks/"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt; and sitting in the front rows. These are the best ways to get results out of conferences, and I intend to employ them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-final-countdown"&gt;The final countdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend is approaching very quickly! WCTO is looking to be an excellent event, and I’m excited to see it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in attendance, make sure to give me a shout! I’m more than happy to have a chat at any time during the event. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or pick me out of the crowd, I look forward to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;
