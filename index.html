<h1 class="article-title"><a href="/articles/imperfect-design/">Stop designing perfectly</a></h1>
<p class="article-intro">
	Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect.
</p>

<p>With this mindset, we strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.</p>

<p>But are we going about this all wrong?</p>

<p><em>I think we are.</em></p>

<h2 id="school-marks">School marks</h2>

<p>Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through elementary school, we’re taught that a mark of A is the ultimate standard to achieve. In our minds it’s 100%, because we can’t go any higher.</p>

<p>However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.</p>

<p>When we arrive at highschool we learn that an A is actually part of a <em>range of percentages</em>. Getting an A could mean anything from 80% to 100%.</p>

<p>If our “ultimate standard” is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, we realize that our ultimate standard is actually easier to achieve.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-shifts">The standard shifts</h2>

<p>This shifting standard, where 80% to 100% is our top game, is a really good thing for us.</p>

<p>It lets us reevaluate what it means to achieve the top of our game, and remove the expectation of perfection.</p>

<p>Let’s look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of “marks” to judge our work, instead of just 100%?</p>

<h2 id="design-isnt-perfect">Design isn’t perfect</h2>

<p>Design doesn’t have to be perfect. The high standard that we want to achieve is possible without toiling forever to create that mythical 100% design.</p>

<p>A design that looks 80% right still gets an A.</p>

<p>This can benefit us greatly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We stop spending too much time designing things;</li>
  <li>Our newfound time can be used talking with customers to find out what they think;</li>
  <li>This feedback can be used to improve the design the way customers want it to be improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time we’d have spent delaying our product’s launch to get a perfect design is much better spent.</p>

<p>Design isn’t perfect. Don’t try to make it be. You’ll still get an A without getting 100%.</p>

<hr />

<p>Keep highschool marks in mind as you go forth to design the next “best”-looking product. Don’t try and be perfect right off the bat, give it time. An 80% is still an A.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing all your imperfect designs.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This article was inspired by <a href="http://arleym.com/breaking-the-rules/">an article by Arley McBlain</a>, where he mentioned that you can write less code and still have an element that looks 85% great. His stuff rocks, go read it.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://johnafish.ca">John Fish</a>, a good friend of mine, wrote up <a href="http://johnafish.ca/writing/perfection.html">a response to this piece</a>. His take is interesting, though I’d like to point out that I never said making mistakes was okay. Go check it out, it provides a good differing perspective to this issue.</p>
