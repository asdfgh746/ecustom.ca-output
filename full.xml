    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don’t list features for your online product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t care that much about the fact that your service integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, Drive, and your refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t care about how your service works. They do care about how it will help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-greeks"&gt;The Greeks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look back around two and a half thousand years to see why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle wrote about &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pathos.&lt;/em&gt; Logos is about appealing to logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you list features, you’re appealing to their sense of logic. You’re having them use logic to understand how your product will work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you’re trying to convince someone to do something – whether that’s to sign up for a mailing list, to sign up for a free trial, or to register an account with your service – it’s far better to appeal to their &lt;em&gt;pathos,&lt;/em&gt; or their sense of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re creatures of emotion. Because we’re like this, we’re naturally attracted to those things which appeal to our emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can your product appeal to your potential users’ emotions instead of just their logic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="explain-what-it-does-for-your-users-instead-of-how-its-done"&gt;Explain what it does for your users… instead of how it’s done.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your product page has a list of features like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, and Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autosaves your work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has keyboard shortcuts for editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list of features appeals to logic pretty well. It’s very clear how the product works. However, it doesn’t really appeal to your users’ emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewrite this feature list to better explain what the product can do for your users, and why it’s useful for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrates with Dropbox, iCloud, and Drive. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Access your work wherever you are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autosaves your work. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Never worry about changes to your work being lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has keyboard shortcuts for editing. -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Cut down on time and be more efficient with your editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how our three new list items do a much better job of explaining to a potential user how your product can help them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now appealing to the emotional side of your users… a much more powerful pull than just logic alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="not-just-for-product-pages"&gt;Not just for product pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extends to working with clients, too. Don’t sell your client on the fact that you’ll create a “WordPress site” for them. Usually, they won’t know about the technology, and they won’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do care about the fact that the website you provide them will do the job they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this applies to just about any situation where the goal is to convince someone. You want to appeal to the emotional side of the person you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appealing to emotions is much more powerful because they have such strong effects on us. Harness the power of emotions when you explain the benefits of what your service does. Harness the power of emotions when you explain why you’re the best freelancer for the job. Harness the power of emotions when you need people to listen to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop listing features. Start explaining what you can do for your users, and start gaining customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Want some help moving away from feature lists? I’d love to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;help you out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Run your business like a school</title>
    <published>2013-07-27T19:00:00Z</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from education systems. They’ve worked for years to find organizational structures that work for them, and we can improve our businesses a lot by modelling ourselves after their proven models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common school models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “integrated” approach, where students from kindergarten to grade 8 are all in the same building.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “dedicated” approach, where the entire school is composed of students in grade 7 and 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each has their own benefits and downfalls. Your business will be better off if you adopt the first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="put-everyone-together-and-watch-progress-happen"&gt;Put everyone together and watch progress happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated approach is awesome for business. Think of each specialty in your team as a different grade. Depending on your business, you might have designers, developers, and copywriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring all these talents into close proximity with one another. This lets them work with each other, finding partners who complement their skills so that they can build awesome products together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage passive collaboration like this. It allows skills to come together which might not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-culture-by-encouraging-mingling"&gt;Build culture by encouraging mingling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive collaboration works great, but there comes a time when you need to encourage members of your team to get to know each other on non-work terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this in the schools with “reading buddy” programs, where older grades go read with the younger grades. This is forced mingling, and it helps to build a sense of community by forcing people to meet who may not have otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this community is essential. It becomes the lifeblood of your organization, your company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a good company culture, so encourage its growth by encouraging people to get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting you go right now and tell two people on your team to start reading to each other. Provide venues through which your team gets together and can get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be as simple as your whole team having lunch together (and not talking about work), or as elaborate as a one week retreat to a sunny destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the mingling style that works for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-a-facilitator"&gt;Be a facilitator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers in integrated schools are facilitators. They provide the place for different people to come together, and then they step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do a great service to your business by providing that space for people to come together, both in a working context and in a casual context. Your business should have a work/life balance, and you want the opportunities you afford your team to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring everybody together, both for work and for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For work, you want to put all your skills in one place. There’s little point in separating out these skills, because that creates walled gardens where you have complex processes to communicate between “departments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walled gardens are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For life, you want all your awesome people to get to know each other. Provide opportunities for them to befriend one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, who doesn’t prefer working with friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work hard to bring about these changes within your organization. Run it like a school, and enjoy the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A change of typeface</title>
    <published>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-21T01:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/change-of-face/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve changed the typeface used for the main body copy on this site. It was &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro"&gt;Freight Text Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m now using &lt;a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova"&gt;Proxima Nova&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freight Text wasn’t doing it for me anymore. Firstly, it wasn’t rendering very nicely for me. Secondly, I wanted to change away from a serif face. We’re used to reading sans-serif on the web by now, I don’t see a need here for a serif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with changing the typeface, I also decreased the overall type size. It was far too in your face previously. One of the skills of a designer is to know when to apply constraint — previously I hadn’t done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new typeface pairing will be reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://svbtle.com"&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt;. I mean no disrespect to Dustin, but rather the utmost &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt; as a designer for what he achieved there. I like Proxima Nova as body text, and keeping Freight Sans for the headings looked nicer to me than Proxima Nova did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping the new typeface and type sizing are a bit easier on the eyes for everyone reading here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Stop designing perfectly</title>
    <published>2013-07-20T20:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-20T20:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/imperfect-design/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
	Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this mindset, we strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are we going about this all wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think we are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="school-marks"&gt;School marks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through elementary school, we’re taught that a mark of A is the ultimate standard to achieve. In our minds it’s 100%, because we can’t go any higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrive at highschool we learn that an A is actually part of a &lt;em&gt;range of percentages&lt;/em&gt;. Getting an A could mean anything from 80% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our “ultimate standard” is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, we realize that our ultimate standard is actually easier to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-standard-shifts"&gt;The standard shifts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shifting standard, where 80% to 100% is our top game, is a really good thing for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets us reevaluate what it means to achieve the top of our game, and remove the expectation of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of “marks” to judge our work, instead of just 100%?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-isnt-perfect"&gt;Design isn’t perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design doesn’t have to be perfect. The high standard that we want to achieve is possible without toiling forever to create that mythical 100% design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design that looks 80% right still gets an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can benefit us greatly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We stop spending too much time designing things;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our newfound time can be used talking with customers to find out what they think;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This feedback can be used to improve the design the way customers want it to be improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time we’d have spent delaying our product’s launch to get a perfect design is much better spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design isn’t perfect. Don’t try to make it be. You’ll still get an A without getting 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep highschool marks in mind as you go forth to design the next “best”-looking product. Don’t try and be perfect right off the bat, give it time. An 80% is still an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing all your imperfect designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This article was inspired by &lt;a href="http://arleym.com/breaking-the-rules/"&gt;an article by Arley McBlain&lt;/a&gt;, where he mentioned that you can write less code and still have an element that looks 85% great. His stuff rocks, go read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnafish.ca"&gt;John Fish&lt;/a&gt;, a good friend of mine, wrote up &lt;a href="http://johnafish.ca/writing/perfection.html"&gt;a response to this piece&lt;/a&gt;. His take is interesting, though I’d like to point out that I never said making mistakes was okay. Go check it out, it provides a good differing perspective to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">WordCamp Atlanta: How to Make Six Figures in Web Design</title>
    <published>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-16T19:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/how-to-make-6-figures-in-web-design/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Atlanta 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdalman"&gt;James Dalman&lt;/a&gt; talked about how to build a profitable business on web design. &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JamesDalman/how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/04/21/james-dalman-how-to-make-six-figures-in-web-design/"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many web workers don’t many any money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The key to making money is knowing how to run a business that provides for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business is about failures, not successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="focus-on-your-strengths"&gt;Focus on your strengths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find “what you’re made for,” and do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be a jack of all trades. Learn other skills, but don’t worry if you’re not good at them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This prevents you from being spread too thin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="build-your-confidence"&gt;Build your confidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, neither will clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident in what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do. For the things you’re not confident in, know people who are, and direct business their way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be confident. People notice. (James recounted stories about how he’s gotten business just by being confident, because people appreciate and are more comfortable with confidence.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="invest-in-relationships"&gt;Invest in relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building clients relationships is essential to business. It’s easier to keep an existing client happy than to find a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your clients. You want to ease their pain and make them happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t build relationships to get something out of it. That’s the wrong approach. Build authentic relationships, and let whatever happens happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A great way to build relationships is by attending meetups and conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="find-great-clients"&gt;Find great clients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe in yourself. Believe that you’re good at what you do and that you can find great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great clients won’t balk at higher prices, because they understand the value you offer. This ties into being confident. Be confident that you can price high, because you have great clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the best interests of clients in mind. They’ll appreciate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to emails and phone calls can be a powerful tool! So many jobs can be missed just by not networking in these simple ways.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communication might fall apart with clients. Overcommunicate to compensate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sell-true-value"&gt;Sell true value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell your work on its value, not by an hourly rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clients want to see the value and the benefits you offer, not how much you’re going to charge them every hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value can work better for you, because it can sometimes mean you make an enormous hourly rate, just because you were able to work fast. (The corollary is true, too, but be confident and it won’t matter.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Selling on value inspires you to work fast and not milk the clock, which results in good work done more quickly, which makes for happy clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="price-for-profit"&gt;Price for profit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you offer services, you want to make money for offering them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re freelancing, you want to make profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="do-awesome-work"&gt;Do awesome work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the best way to build your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go the extra mile and be the best you can in what you put out for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good work can bring in even more business, because people recognize your talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open doors require effort to find. Opportunities don’t just come up, you need to put in the work to get them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Act on your ideas, or they’ll never get done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business isn’t about making the money. It’s about building awesome work and providing opportunities for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you spend a lot of time learning, that’s great. But you need to spend time acting on that learning, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: this is when the question period began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transition-to-selling-new-clients-on-value"&gt;Transition to selling new clients on value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guess the number of hours it’ll take you, pad it by a large margin, and then present the lump sum cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain the value people need which you can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strike-a-balance-between-learning-and-doing"&gt;Strike a balance between learning and doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time can be very well spent on action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep reading what’s current.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend time building business connections in addition to learning and doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-and-quality-is-what-to-focus-on-when-finding-partners"&gt;Value and quality is what to focus on when finding partners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the quality in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t use microlancing sites to outsource. They devalue the industry on a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="for-small-tasks-after-launch-hourly-is-okay"&gt;For small tasks after launch, hourly is okay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t know how long it could take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, slap a small lump sum down that corresponds to your expected hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiny edits should be free. Don’t nickel and dime your clients, they’ll know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="need-resources-for-designers"&gt;Need resources for designers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step by step mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information about building businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="turning-down-clients-is-fine"&gt;Turning down clients is fine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t do a project just for the money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can get locked into a painful project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow what your gut tells you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="networking"&gt;Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relationships take a long time to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing can be a good jumpstart to this process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cold-calling” can work sometimes, but often leads to rejection or bad clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partner with people who complement your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look around your network for good people. Hangout and befriend them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="payment"&gt;Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you partner with someone, have them in the process the whole time, but have the client pay them separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% down payment, once a project starts, no money back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put your terms in your invoice, your “contract” can be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take payment out of your system straight into your bank upon receiving it, to prevent people trying to take it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I do all my writing in the open. Anyone can view what I'm working on, the ugly drafts and the stupid ideas, at any time. This rocks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I write in the open? For those adventurous few who want to delve into my site’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, they can see all the writing I have. They can see the finished articles, the drafts, and the discarded but never deleted ideas. It’s all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-accountable"&gt;Be accountable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing in the open, I’m accountable. I know that someone could be reading my work long before it’s available, so I have to make it top-notch. Not only that, but I know that they could be looking at my work from months ago, which pushes me to make better content that outshines that writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can see that I have works which are still not published, and that I haven’t seen fit to delete it yet. I’m accountable to the people who see my writing sitting unpublished, because they know I have unfinished work. I don’t like having unfinished work, so it pushes me to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-transparent"&gt;Be transparent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing in the open, I can give sneak peeks. People see my work before it’s unpublished, and they get a chance to look at my process. They can see the work evolve by looking at the piece’s history. For example, I recently broke out a section of a larger essay I was writing into its own article, which ended up being my piece about &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/17hhiLk"&gt;my writing workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the veil like this allows people to see some of my thought process. They can watch the evolution of my thoughts and learn more about me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency is great, because it builds &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;. And having people who trust you is an awesome thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="be-bold"&gt;Be bold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead, put your unfinished work out there. Be bold, be confident. Don’t be afraid of what it might say about you. Do it often enough, and it’ll be a part of who you are, and people will come to respect and value you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing your unfinished work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Want to see &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; latest unfinished work? You can read my aforementioned &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/13qPwrn"&gt;essay on writing&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some thoughts on it, I’d love to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;hear them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">My writing workflow</title>
    <published>2013-07-15T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-15T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/my-writing-workflow/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
My writing workflow has evolved considerably over the past few years, going from zero in 2010, to where I am today. This evolution is largely due to the changing tools I use to publish and promote my writing, in addition to the type of writing I try to put out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the writing workflow I use, before diving into some of the issues with it and then considering what features of the process I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-workflow"&gt;The workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workflow is what brings me from initial idea conception to publishing. All pieces of writing I publish go through this process, or the majority of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An idea comes to me. This could be in the shower, on the bus, or late at night as I toss and turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write my idea down. The idea gets stored in whatever medium is convenient at the time, whether it’s my Moleskine that I carry around, or in Google Keep, or on the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I have time, I start fleshing out further thoughts around the idea. This usually manifests itself in random sentences which represent the core thoughts I wish to share.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, I’ll return to my ideas and start writing in a large notebook or typing my thoughts on my trusty &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_Series"&gt;Thinkpad T42&lt;/a&gt; (I use it almost exclusively for writing, because the keyboard is so damn good). This step is the one that often causes trouble for me, because the thoughts and inspiration surrounding me when I originally had the idea are no longer present, so I have much difficulty in writing my idea out in a way that befits my original passion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll then edit my writing, usually by passing it off to a friend and then reading it over myself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll publish the piece. Almost all my writing is published on this website, while I also decide to cross-publish some of the pieces on &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. This publishing step has a deceptive number of substeps if I’m publishing to my site, due to the way my publishing system is set up. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll start promoting the piece on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook, and by word of mouth (yep, that’s still a useful method in our online world).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process works okay (it’s resulting in this article, isn’t it?); but it doesn’t allow for some things which I consider very useful from writing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the issues with this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system isn’t very good at &lt;em&gt;sharing ideas&lt;/em&gt;. There’s no incentive for people to share, and there’s no built in large audience who will read my work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system doesn’t allow for actually writing and publishing the entire article from anywhere. I’m still tied down to using a computer with specialized software to publish my pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea can go cold. This ties into the previous point. Because I can’t write my entire article and then share it from anywhere, I’m limited in my “window of passion.” I have to make the most of very limited tools to write down my thoughts once I come upon an idea, and that often isn’t enough to craft a good piece of art before the idea disappears from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual publishing process (step 6) is a major pain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When I publish something, I have to first format the file in Markdown using a special header to provide the article metadata. Then, I have to commit it to git, and push it to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca"&gt;GitHub repo for this website&lt;/a&gt;. Then, I have to rebuild the site using nanoc, commit the results of that to git repo and push that repo to &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca-output"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, I have to SSH into my web server and &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; the repo back down from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, this is largely self-inflicted due to my insistence on using &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; to publish instead of a dynamic system like &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;; but it helps to illustrate the point that a good writing process, and thus a good writing system, should be easy to publish from.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pains are all either self-inflicted, or pains that exist with most publishing systems or writing workflows. They’re largely unavoidable, thanks to the nature of the tools available and what we expect to receive from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nice-bits"&gt;Nice bits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process does allow for a few niceties, though, which other systems do not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have control over the location of all my content, and can access it at any time. Because my content resides entirely in either: (a) sheets of paper in my notebooks, or (b) plaintext files on my computers, I control where it is. I don’t have to worry about exporting it from a company who may or may not allow that in the future… I already have it with me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have control over the presentation. Good ideas require good presentation to accompany them, in order to best &lt;em&gt;communicate&lt;/em&gt; them to their audience. Great ideas can be communicated via unstyled HTML just fine, but we’ve come to expect a higher quality from the information we read today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these points illustrate what I think is an important trait to value in writing systems — control. Important to me, my system allows the control of my writing to reside in my hands, and mine alone. Although I store my files on GitHub or on my web server, I still have complete copies of the git repositories on all my local machines, ready for the day I have to abandon those services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="in-short"&gt;In short&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My writing system is a bit janky, but it allows for me to, in a reasonable manner, come up with an idea, store it for later, revisit it and write it up, then publish it, without too much pain. Would it be easier if I moved parts of it to use a more dynamic publishing system, like WordPress? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s important to take away from this piece, though, is that what works for writing is what works for you. My system is far from perfect, or even ideal, and I will always be tweaking it to be better. However, it works for me in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after all, isn’t it true that all we want to do is share our ideas with the rest of the world? If your system can do that, I think it’s the right one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al: Professional WordPress Deployment</title>
    <published>2013-07-07T02:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-07T02:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/professional-wordpress-deployment-rami-sayar/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Montréal 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ramisayar"&gt;Rami Sayar&lt;/a&gt; talked about moving from a developed product to a deployed one. &lt;a href="http://slid.es/sayar/prowp"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="professional-software"&gt;Professional software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-availability, very reliable, being maintained and kept up-to-date continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managed releases - they’re tested, and it’s clear what changes are being sent out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only a select few can access production and deploy there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses a consistent, versioned, automated software stack so that software is guaranteed to work across environments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses automated deployment to go quickly, without downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software is auditable, with quality logs dating far back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="world-class-frontends-need-world-class-backends"&gt;“World-class frontends need world-class backends”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer operations (devops) has to be everywhere throughout development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://prowp.org/"&gt;ProWP.org&lt;/a&gt; for devops resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="git"&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use submodules to track and manage histories separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t clone WordPress, fork it then use it as the upstream repo. This allows you to get new changes from WordPress as they come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vagrantpackerio-for-machine-images"&gt;Vagrant/Packer.io for machine images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vagrant is a tool to &lt;em&gt;describe&lt;/em&gt; a virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vagrantpress is an Ubuntu Vagrant machine which is already setup with WordPress included.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Packer.io allows building identical cross-platform images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="chefpuppet"&gt;Chef/Puppet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chef and Puppet are two similar tools to allow for configuration file deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chef is better for multi-server deployments (as it requires a lead server which others get config instructions from), whilst Puppet is better for single-server or a very limited number of servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="miscellany"&gt;Miscellany&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WP-CLI allows for the creation and control of WordPress installations using the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For open-source projects, use a tool such as Travis CI or Jenkins for testing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Relic is a good tool for server monitoring, while Nagios is a good open source alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When performing host migrations, employ a code freeze as well as a content freeze (at least, do so for staging).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;memcached + batcache are a powerful combination for caching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Automattic Developer plugin provides tons of great plugins for development purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/build-a-website-on-the-moon-sarah-semark/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Montréal 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarahsemark"&gt;Sarah Semark&lt;/a&gt; talked about how to develop WordPress sites from just about anywhere. &lt;a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/talks/moon"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-local-development-rocks"&gt;Why local development rocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faster development - no need to wait for uploads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better testing - change all the file without affecting production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Version control - keep a revision history using git.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A nicer production server - it’s more stable, with less downtime and outages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaboration - can work better because you don’t have two people editing the same files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployment - can automate deployment, getting rid of a lot of human error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tools"&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use an XAMP stack (Operating system, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for your server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git for version control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automation scripts to sync your database changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="xamp"&gt;XAMP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your virtual hosts, allowing multiple sites, each with their own “domain” (can use something like wallybills.dev).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="git"&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A very fast system to track changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use your remote, or staging, location (like GitHub or BitBucket) to solve conflicts, not production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file to ignore &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt;, all machine-specific files, and &lt;em&gt;anything with sensitive data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On production, keep your &lt;code&gt;.git/&lt;/code&gt; folder one level above your web root (&lt;code&gt;public_html/&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;www/&lt;/code&gt;, or similar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="database-automation"&gt;Database automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep all your site data in sync when you make file changes. (Sarah has some files &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/sarahsemark/5889465"&gt;on GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt; to help you out here.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull data down from production to your local machine so you have real content created by clients to style.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t use PHPMyAdmin to sync. Automate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the table prefix the same between local and production, for simplicity’s sake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; folder out of the web root.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No sensitive files in the web root.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can move &lt;code&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/code&gt; up one level from the WordPress install location, and WordPress will still find it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/notes/plugins-a-double-edged-sword-yannick-lefebvre/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
At WordCamp Montréal 2013, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ylefebvre"&gt;Yannick Lefebvre&lt;/a&gt; talked about WordPress plugins from a user/integrator perspective. &lt;a href="http://ylefebvre.ca/wcmtl13"&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;. Here are my notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="things-to-check-before-using-a-plugin"&gt;Things to check before using a plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compatability - does it work for your version?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;# of Downloads - higher counts are generally a good indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ratings - take with a grain of salt, because anyone can vote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;# of Resolved Threads - doesn’t take into account support delivered outside of WordPress.org. Some developers use their own forums for support, and are very active there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="things-to-do-before-deploying-a-3suprdsup-party-plugin"&gt;Things to do before deploying a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;-party plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check render time before installing it, and then check after. Check both the front and back end. Are the load times acceptable? &lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: if your plugin provides a feature only used on select pages (e.g. a shortcode), make sure to check the performance of&lt;/em&gt; those &lt;em&gt;pages especially.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log out and view the site as a regular user. Does it still work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="troubleshooting-a-faulty-plugin"&gt;Troubleshooting a faulty plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deactivate the last plugin installed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deactivate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; plugins and activate each one again, one at a time. Refresh your site each time, see when it breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the plugin page, check for install instructions you may have missed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact the author if all else fails and you absolutely need the plugin to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="style-issues"&gt;Style issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conflicting styles between the plugin’s styles and yours, or one plugin’s styles and another.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the inspector to find the “winning styles.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can modify the theme to fix these issues. &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; can come in handy here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can modify the plugin, but make sure to backup the files first and know that your changes will be overwritten if you automatically update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jquery-issues"&gt;jQuery issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often breaks all the jQuery-affected elements on a page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the console of the inspector for errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Common issue is more than one jQuery verison being loaded. Check for multiple copies in the source, or in the inspector’s scripts section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When using jQuery, use the longform version (jQuery()) instead of the shorthand ($()) to avoid conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="upload-issues"&gt;Upload issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write permissions may be wrong on the upload folder. &lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: 755 should do the trick, according to the &lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions"&gt;WordPress Codex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The server max upload size (set in php.ini) may be too small. By default it’s 8MB, but some hosts turn it down. Contact yours to see how to change it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="troubleshooting-bad-upgrades"&gt;Troubleshooting bad upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reactivate the plugin. (Especially when uploaded with FTP).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check for error messages, and &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revert to a previous version (you do have a backup, don’t you?).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find previous version (if you don’t have a backup), by browsing the Trac page for the plugin (when on WordPress.org) and checking for tags, or showing revisions. &lt;em&gt;Lucas’ note: just make a backup regularly, it’ll save you so much hassle in the long run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bad-plugin-breakups"&gt;Bad plugin breakups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You may “break up” with a plugin when you find one that’s a better solution for your needs, or if what you’re using now provides unnecessary functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The plugin development may have ended, and it may not support new versions of WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to analyse the effects of deactivation. Plugin authors rarely remember to include features which clean up after being uninstalled, so you may have to do this yourself.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title type="html">A Lack of Comments</title>
    <published>2013-07-07T00:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/no-comments/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;Comments are viewed as being an essential part of any website delivering primarily written content, such as this one. So why is this site devoid of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of comments has always been a concious choice of mine — this site was never meant to have any. However, it was called to my attention in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardmtl/status/353190233967296512"&gt;Tweet by Richard Archambault&lt;/a&gt; the other day that I haven’t yet explained myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of comments is attributable to two factors: implementation, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t use a truly dynamic publishing system like WordPress to create my website. The tool I use, &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;, is designed for the creation of static-file websites, which don’t lend themselves particularly well to comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no plans to change away from nanoc for the moment, so that option isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might say. Why don’t you use a third-party hosted comment solution like &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against Disqus in particular, but I do take issue with having too many external dependencies, as well as not having control over the appearance of all my site’s components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Disqus (or any similar hosted comments service) forces me to load the necessary scripts from their servers (which I try to limit how often I do), as well as to use the styles they provide. Unfortunately, none of the styles they offer fit in with the message I try to send with this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside about losing centralized comments is that it’s difficult to see all the different reactions that have occurred. However, my strategy to combat that is simple: update the article in question with links to the external commentary, with a response of my own. (This whole post is really an example of that, thanks again to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardmtl"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I could have comments on the site in a technical manner which I agree with, I’m not sure I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="philosophy"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what’s really stopped me from including comments. I don’t believe it’s necessary to have comments on personal sites anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion around posts will still happen (does still happen). However it occurs on other mediums. I receive comments via Twitter, via Facebook, via email, and I feel that the ones I receive there matter more than if I had received them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are contacting me using those methods, it usually means that they actually have something of substance to say about what I wrote. What they say over Facebook or Twitter is more public than what they say here, so they’re more likely to put out high quality content, if they put anything out at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for high quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-door-is-still-open"&gt;The Door is (Still) Open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omitting comments doesn’t mean I’ve closed the door to discussion on my pieces of writing. It just means I’ve decided to move that discussion elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A Talk a Day</title>
    <published>2013-07-06T02:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-06T02:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-talk-a-day/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;With a rather empty summer schedule, I've put some plans in place to make the most of it, by watching a talk a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer will be the least scheduled I’ve ever had; because my family isn’t traveling for any major vacations and I’m only volunteering for two weeks, I’ll have lots of spare time to myself. I know that if I don’t fill that spare time with something useful, I’ll wither intellectually… So I’ve put together my “talk a day” plan to keep myself engaged through the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a great intellectual kickoff to my summer with my attendance at &lt;a href="/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013"&gt;WordCamp Montréal 2013&lt;/a&gt;, where I heard lots of great talks and came away with plenty of notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for ways to keep myself learning, I realized that one of the best ways to do so this summer would be to continue listening and taking notes on talks. Fortunately for me (and the WordPress community at large), just about every talk that occurs at WordCamps are recorded and uploaded to &lt;a href="http://wordpress.tv"&gt;WordPress.tv&lt;/a&gt;. This is the perfect resource to use to “attend” plenty of talks that you’d have no opportunity to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various WordPress-specific talks available from WordPress.tv, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers"&gt;Google Developers&lt;/a&gt; puts up video of just about every session they’ve ever hosted. Special gems are the feature talks from Google I/O, which are always worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are various other random talks which I’ll chance upon to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-goal"&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to watch (on average) a talk a day. I’m also taking notes as I watch these talks, as I would if I were actually in the room. This has the added benefit of improving my handwriting, which is something I’ve always been a bit ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a pretty sustainable goal, given the time I have. I’ve been trying it out the past few days and I’ve had no trouble setting aside an hour before bed to watch a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you to try and join me in reaching this goal. I understand the extra time I have is a bit of a luxury, but watching the interesting talks which suit your tastes during your spare time will go a long way towards furthering your knowledge and keeping your mind sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-sharing"&gt;The Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to writing out my notes during the talk by hand, I also want to take the time (when I can) to type up my notes for the talks and publish them here. The parsing of unstructured notes into more structured versions for digital publishing will help me to learn the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this can help provide a good accompaniment to the slide decks usually published by these authors, for those who don’t have the time or means to watch the videos, but are able to read my notes and view the slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-talks"&gt;The Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this intellectual journey with WordCamp Montréal 2013. You can view the talks I attended &lt;a href="/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013/#talks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks I want to watch are a large cross section, covering the various aspects of digital publishing. From design to development to content creation, I’m interested in the full gamut. While my skills don’t lie in all those areas, I feel I’ll be better equipped to handle the tasks set before me if I’m well-versed in the various aspects facing digital publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watching presenters from such a variety of fields covering such a variety of topics will prepare me better for my eventual speaking endeavours. I’m applying to speak at &lt;a href="http://2013.toronto.wordcamp.org/"&gt;WordCamp Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in October, as well as WordCamp Montréal next summer, plus some other events in between. I’ll be much more prepared to handle these situations if I have more exposure to the different styles present at WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of any great talks that I’ve missed, please let me know using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or, if you prefer, by &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#108;&amp;#117;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#117;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for the great collection of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks I’ve watched after that are as follows (I’ll keep this list updated as I go):&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">After WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al 2013</title>
    <published>2013-07-03T18:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-07-03T18:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/after-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
	This was my &lt;a href="/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;second WordCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and it will definitely not be my last. WordCamp Montréal (WCMTL) fulfilled all &lt;a href="/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"&gt;my expectations&lt;/a&gt; and went beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around I decided to loosen up a bit more than I did previously, and did my best to meet people and get to know about what they did. Needless to say, that resulted in a far more interesting experience for me than when I focused on the talks exclusively, as I did when I attended WCTO: Developers. (See &lt;a href="#talks"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for the talks I attended.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of people to meet at WCMTL, and there was rarely a time when I felt I had nobody to speak with. Everyone there was very open and accepting, and I think everyone went in with the mindset of meeting people, which worked well for everyone present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed talking with some of the various organizers of the event: Shannon, Kirk, Carl, Richard (didn’t get to meet Richard), and Jeremy, all of whom were great people who were clearly capable of putting on a great event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, meeting people such as Yannick Lefebvre, Dion Hulse, and Brian Levine who all gave great advice and encouragement about their field was much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many more people whom I got the chance to speak with at the event that I couldn’t list here. Rest assured that the people who attended WCMTL were top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="education"&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending, I published that I wanted to discuss how WordPress could be used in education, to teach digital publishing; but also to teach web development and “how to code.” To this end, I had discussions with many people about the potential for WordPress to fill that role, including Al Davis, who heads up education at &lt;a href="http://www.wpuniversity.com/"&gt;WPUniversity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many unique perspectives about the issue, including some which ran contrary to what I was pushing for. That’s perfectly acceptable, and I appreciated the different outlooks on what coding issue should be like in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re at a time where WordPress has the potential to be really disruptive in coding education. I’d like to help instigate that push, so expect to hear more from me on that topic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wrap-up"&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordCamp Montréal was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of the organizers, speakers, volunteers, and the help of the sponsors, it was an awesome event, a great way to mark its 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to come back next year if schedules allow, and I’ll hopefully be able to ramp up the number of WordCamps I attend in the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved these talk links to the bottom, because the sea of blue was rather ugly. I’ll be posting my notes on all of them in time, but here are the links to the slide decks and presenter Twitter accounts. In chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Before WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al 2013</title>
    <published>2013-06-26T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-06-26T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/before-wordcamp-montreal-2013/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;WordCamp Montr&amp;eacute;al is fast approaching, and I'm looking forward to what I'm sure will be a fantastic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve attended only &lt;a href="/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"&gt;one other WordCamp before&lt;/a&gt;, not being fortunate enough to join in on the good fun in &lt;a href="http://2013.ottawa.wordcamp.org/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wordcamphamilton.com/"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;; however it was a great experience which I’m sure will be replicated (or surpassed!) by Montréal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talks that have been lined-up for this event are looking good. An interesting trend is the move towards development talks that feature more and more heavily into performance, studying and optimising for it. &lt;a href="http://digitalize.ca/"&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt; will be talking about caching, while &lt;a href="http://www.taylorlovett.com/"&gt;Taylor Lovett&lt;/a&gt; will be talking about looking at WordPress from a Computer Science perspective — a new one for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to be sitting in on some content strategy and writing talks. Given my move towards a more generalized approach when working with clients, the additional knowledge will be useful (plus, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KO_DavidH"&gt;David Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; will be presenting on the subject and I’ve wanted the chance to hear one of his talks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://ma.tt"&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; will be holding an open floor question session to end the event, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who are attending WCMTL are looking to be a fine bunch, as is to be expected! There will be people of all types attending, some who I’ve met before, some who I’ve seen in the distance before, and some who I’ve only ever seen online. Of course, there will be many more I’ve never seen, and I hope to connect with them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going off my experience at WCTO, I know there will be great opportunities to connect with people through the event. I’m expecting to (though holding out hope that I won’t) be the youngest person at the event, which is always an interesting position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope to connect with some of the people I’ve interacted with a little over Twitter in the last few months, and hopefully get a few minutes to chat with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wordpress-and-education"&gt;WordPress and Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the things I hope to take away from WCMTL, I really want to hear people’s thoughts on a subject which has been nagging at me lately: How can we better use WordPress as a platform to teach web development (or coding, or programming, or …) skills in schools?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is great potential for the WordPress project to fill a role where it provides clear ways for students to apply themselves in an educational setting and learn more about web development as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is already WordPress being applied in an educational setting; but it acts more as a communications tool than a development teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from experience, the current state of “web design/development” education in schools (at least what I’ve seen) is pitiful. Using Dreamweaver to create table-based layouts with garish colours is hardly what I’d deem to be employable skills (or even skills which inspire students to learn more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There needs to be a movement away from this, and I think WordPress could be a part of that. Taking people and offering them real problems (in the context of WordPress) for them to solve could lead to some innovative solutions and some great future coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting we create classes centred around contributing to core, because education goals could conflict with the goals of core and the workflow surrounding core contribution; but I think there needs to be some way for educators to have their students learn using WordPress, as opposed to dated technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="looking-forward-to-the-weekend"&gt;Looking Forward to the Weekend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m definitely looking forward to what will happen this weekend. I’m prepared (kind of, not packed at all) to see a great collection of talks and to meet the many people who will be attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there will be an avenue by which to have some good discussion about education and WordPress, in addition to all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll be at WordCamp Montréal this weekend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;send me a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll make sure to meet up with you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;Technology has the ability to do great things, as has been demonstrated numerous times throughout history. It has revolutionized industries, created new ones, and spelled the demise of others. Today, however, we are using technology to evolve industries; building upon the foundations of an industry, and re-imagining how work can be done within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the stacks of pen and paper in retail, instead being replaced by the mouse and keyboard. The inefficiencies of the hospital waiting room are being improved by always-on access to patient records, making sure people with pressing issues are admitted first. And in education, perhaps the most important, students are being engaged in learning through new methods, using technologies such as the Internet to access information, instead of paper textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three industries (retail, medical, and education) are being affected very strongly by technology today, and the effects of technology run deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="retail-industry"&gt;Retail Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retail industry has evolved significantly in recent years, notably since the advent of computers. “Retail” was at its core the same industry in 1900 as it was in 1750—inefficient and often slow. People did not have access to the same goods that people take for granted today, perhaps because there was no easy method of managing distribution and buying or selling. However, when retail industry members realized how to properly implement computer systems in their business model, things began to change drastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stock-levels-they-are-a-changin"&gt;Stock Levels, They Are a-Changin’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when stock had to be recorded in paper books and kept in storage. Instead, all store managers have to do now is to input how much stock has been sold, and how much arrived, and their computers can manage knowledge of the store’s stock levels. When stock of a certain item begins to run low, the system notifies the manager to buy more of that item. Advanced systems can run all of this automatically, from the buying of stock to when it is sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some systems, whenever stock is shipped to a certain store, that store is notified of what will be arriving when, so they can anticipate stock levels. The moment an item is bought from the store, the stock levels are adjusted accordingly. When stock of a certain item begins to run low, the store automatically notifies the supplier that it needs more of it, and has it bought and shipped to them. This allows for retail managers to relieve themselves of the duties of administering to stock levels, instead allowing them to focus on interacting with customers or improving the store experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="talk-talk-talkin-to-the-guy-next-door"&gt;Talk, Talk, Talkin’ to The Guy Next Door&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements have been made in other areas of retail, such as communication. Whereas previously communications organizing the sale of components to manufacturers down the supply chain might have been completed through letters or face-to-face meetings, the computer (more specifically the Internet) allows these meetings to happen from anywhere in the world. Video chatting technologies such as Skype allow members of a meeting to see and hear each other, making communications more clear than if they were conducted through letter. This also allows for much faster and cheaper completion of negotiations, as they can be completed with less correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-great-day-for-storage"&gt;A Great Day for Storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage of information has also been affected hugely by computers. The density at which we are storing information has increased dramatically over the years, meaning the amount of space needed to store a piece of information has decreased. In the past, information was recorded on paper and stored in a room somewhere, taking up space. A letter written on standard letter paper would take up the amount of space of that piece of paper, which could become difficult to manage if there was lots of letters being stored. However, with modern storage technologies implemented through the computer, that letter can be stored in far, far, far less physical space than if it was in its physical copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard drives on which computers store information generally have a size of 3.5in, but can store up to 4TB of information on them. To put that in perspective, a letter written in standard letter format, a full page in length takes up approximately 25KB of space, which is a miniscule portion of the capacity of modern hard drives. This allows for far more storage in less space, saving costs for the people needing that storage. Another advantage is brought on by these new storage methods: it takes far less time to find the file or record one is searching for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously people would have to search through boxes of paper records to find the information they needed, but now all they have to do is sit down at a computer and search for the file they are looking for, and they can find it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing information on hard drives does not come without its share of issues. As paper is at risk of catching fire, so too are hard drives, but they have other issues as well. For example, hard drives can and almost always will fail after time, risking the loss of data stored on that hard drives. For that reason hard drives can be easily backed up, all the files copied to another drive, which makes the data much safer. This is an advantage hard drives have over storage methods used in the past, when backing up paper documents involved copying them out again, often by hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="medical-industry"&gt;Medical Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical industry has evolved in ways that could previously only be wished for. Using computers, hospitals are able to maintain a database of patient records, allowing them to organize waiting room times according to highest priority. These records can be shared between hospitals, ensuring an enriched experience offered to patients wherever they go. Computers also allow medical staff to consult with one another with more ease; if a nurse does not know how to deal with a certain issue, they can call up a doctor and have a video conversation so that the doctor can explain with actions and gestures how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient records being available any time and nearly instantly allows for far greater accuracy when completing procedures or diagnosing a patient. For example, if a patient has previous experience getting stung by bees, and has not developed a rash before, but is now suffering a reaction to being stung, doctors and nurses might use this information to help with their diagnosis of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this notion of a database of patient records, there are also databases for medical professionals consisting of knowledge about diseases, medications and their side effects, as well as how to treat certain illnesses or injuries. These allow doctors and nurses to collaborate far more effectively, and can increase the quality of treatment given to a patient. This also allows for medical professionals to not have to learn as much in their education because they will have access to it in a database of treatments once they are in the workforce. This can obviously lead to a decline in the knowledge of practitioners, which is dangerous given how vital they are to the continued well being of the human race. Granted, it is highly unlikely that medical practitioners will simply stop being taught the ins and outs of their craft, to be replaced by a database, but for more obscure treatments they may turn to these exterior information sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, all of a sudden, the medical databases were shut off, and doctors no longer knew how to treat certain cancers or other illnesses? Given, they may have the correct medication, but would they necessarily know the correct ways to administer it to gain maximum affect from its contents? This could be very dangerous if practitioners begin leaning on these external sources of information too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also emerging in medicine online check up methods for less serious illnesses. This may save patients from having to make a trip to the emergency room for something that is not a true emergency. They might instead book a time with their family doctor or general practitioner who can provide the same service the hospital could provide, but without having to go through the emergency room waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has certainly allowed the medical industry to improve and streamline its operations, but is it at the expense of being able to rest assured that a doctor knows how to treat a certain illness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="education-industry"&gt;Education Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education industry is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of technology into classrooms. When the personal computer debuted, innovative educators saw an opportunity to aid and propel student learning using this groundbreaking device, and those who could afford computers bought them for their class. Of course, micro circuitry also allowed for calculators, far more affordable than a personal computer, and more specialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers introduced calculators into their math classes, which allowed students to compute the result of an equation far faster than if they had been using the traditional pen and paper methods. As a result, students began to rely less and less on the traditional methods, instead turning to the calculator which was highly convenient. Teaching practices had to shift as well, to fit with this new paradigm of student learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students began to use different methods to complete their work, teachers had to change as well. No longer was rote memorization as important as emphasized before, as now students could quickly access the information from a variety of different sources, instead of having to think it through. The teacher was not able to as easily control the information fed to children, as the Internet exposed them to a seemingly limitless barrage of it. Therefore, teachers began teaching students better ways to research, better ways to sift through the information they found to find what was of quality. Synthesizing ideas from this information instead of recalling facts was used as a tool to help students understand what they were learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the computer impacted students’ experiences at school in other ways as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, when students had assignments they needed to hand in, it was necessary for them to write them up by hand. Now, students need merely to have access to a computer and a printer to “write up” their assignments, and it is not uncommon to find that a teacher requires the assignment be typed. This led to the fall of teaching handwriting (cursive) in schools, because it was no longer relevant. Why teach a student how to write neatly when in the future all of their work will revolve around typing, which will create perfect looking text for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, teachers became able to teach their students in more ways, as well as being able to support the learning needs of particular students better. When previously a science class may learn entirely from textbooks, now teachers can direct students to use a greater variety of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great improvement to education brought about by modern technologies is that of online learning. Students can take courses taught anywhere in the world from any other place provided they have a connection to the Internet. This can lead to detrimental side effects, however, such as the student not having as great a connection with the teacher or not being able to express themselves through online communications. Words only convey approximately 7% of the message being sent, with tone making up 38% and nonverbal cues making up the other 55%. This shows a weakness of the increasing usage of technology in the classroom, wherein students interact less with their teachers and may not be able to learn to their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology is used more and more within classrooms, it is shifting not only the methods with which teachers teach and students learn, but also the mindsets of students. If one can quickly compute the answer to a math problem using a calculator, why bother with writing it out on paper? This may lead to laziness over time, as well as other detrimental side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, technology being introduced in classrooms is beneficial, but it is important at the same time that teachers teach the “old” methods of learning so that students do not become too reliant on their technology. A generation of students who rely entirely on their calculators to compute math problems would be problematic indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-words"&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of modern technology into our industries is a gift that should not be taken for granted. Being freed from the methods of the past for the methods of the present allows us to reevaluate how we do business and improve the lives of consumers everywhere, as well as those in need of healthcare or education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as modern technology continues to be integrated with our industries, it is important that those integrating the technology consider the potential implications down the line when the technology may not be available. It is of the utmost importance that we do not become so dependent on the technology that when it is not there for us we cannot survive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="notes-on-this-piece"&gt;Notes on this Piece&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This piece was part of a project written for school in my 2011-2012 school year. It’s a bit rough around the edges, but I’m publishing it to lead into future discussions on the evolution of society due to technology, and the resulting effects of that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I also published this piece on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/p/c9b8629f1e99"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, where I will cross-publish future pieces in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A fresh coat of paint</title>
    <published>2013-06-23T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-06-23T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/site-redesign-v4/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
A fresh coat of paint is a useful thing to throw around. It can lead to better looking spaces and refresh your feeling about a place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thrown a new coat of paint on this website, cleaning out some of the old bits and simplifying it even further from the previous incarnation. The changes are mostly cosmetic, so let’s take a look at those first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/ecustom-ca-v3.png" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This site, version 3.0 (created in October of 2012).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/ecustom-ca-v4.png" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This site, version 4.0 (created in June of 2013).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I’ve kept the same basic principles behind the site the same, but the implementation of them has changed a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="typography"&gt;Typography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is now using the most excellent Freight superfamily (Pro and Sans Pro, in this case) by &lt;a href="https://philsfonts.com/index.php/home"&gt;Phil’s Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. After recently purchasing a subscription to &lt;a href="https://typekit.com"&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt;, I was itching to move away from Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the typeface itself, I’ve paid a lot more attention to such typographic features as leading, measure, and vertical emphasis/rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding that last point, I used &lt;a href="http://modularscale.com/"&gt;Modular Scale&lt;/a&gt; to generate a nice typographic scale based off major third musical intervals. Font sizes are all em-based as well, allowing for great resizing just by changing the base size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="colours"&gt;Colours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas previously I was using a monochromatic blue scheme, I’ve spiced it up a bit this time by adding in the accent colours of orange and blue, which complement the base shades of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/ecustom-ca-v4-swatches.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no strategy in picking these colours apart from the fact that they should contrast well and “pop” (whatever that means). I picked them all by clicking randomly in the Photoshop colourpicker until I got ones that worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="workflow"&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core technology running this site is still the same (see my &lt;a href="/articles/the-making-of/"&gt;post about the previous update&lt;/a&gt; for more information), however I did change my workflow significantly this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I depended a lot more upon git and the features it provides for this version. The power of branching was much appreciated as I worked to solve different problems, because I could try out different solutions and switch quickly between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing which I did a bit overzealously with this workflow was commit. If you look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca/commits/master"&gt;repo for this site&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that, before the redesign, I had committed 32 times from October 2012 to June 2013. Since starting upon my redesign journey, I’ve committed 85 times over 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future workflows, I’ll try to not commit incremental changes as much as I did here. I’d like my commit style to be a bit more restrained, and perhaps limit it to implementation of features, or significant work towards doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="contentnavigation"&gt;Content/Navigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequent complaints/points of confusion with the last incarnation was the lack of navigation (other than the link to the home page in the header). This was a major issue. It’s now fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also decided to rewrite my content (already published articles excluded) to be a bit more casual. Amusingly enough, I’d been trying to do so with the last version; but I hadn’t gone quite far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/ecustom-ca-v4-content.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this rewriting, I reorganized and cut down significantly on the amount of content I had that wasn’t article-based. I didn’t need a whole page dedicated to contacting me, so I got rid of it. I added some useful links to the footer, but I didn’t surround them with too much explanation. They can speak for themselves. This is something that we need to do a lot more of—cleaning out and sorting our virtual garages, if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="to-new-adventures"&gt;To new adventures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year has had many big changes in it for me. I decided that this would be a perfect time to rebuild something I’ve always considered a rather core part of my identity, at least the online part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the new adventures coming for me and this site. I’ve got exciting things cooking, and I hope to be revising the design with new features from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it has always been, the core of this site remains its content. I hope the content is strong enough to stand its own without a fancy new coat of paint. But the fresh paint certainly does make it nicer on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">&amp;ldquo;Turn off the clock&amp;rdquo; and other sleep essentials</title>
    <published>2013-04-27T16:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-04-27T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/sleep-essentials/"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;
Sleep. It’s one of the most essential parts of our well-being and yet so many of us don’t get enough of it. I’m not here to tell you to go to sleep earlier, but rather how to get more sleep than you’ve been getting previously, based off some experiences I’ve had recently.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months I’ve been experimenting with a variety of little changes to my sleeping area, with the goal of getting more sleep by falling asleep more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes I’ve made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hide my clock;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quiet my music;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a notebook and pen beside me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these experiments has yielded me varying levels of success. Of course, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hide-the-alarm-clock"&gt;Hide the alarm clock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having my alarm clock and the time visible beside me was causing me unnecessary stress as I would check the time repeatedly. This would only serve to make me angry and worried at my slow progress into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiding the time on my alarm clock made me less worried about how long I was taking to fall asleep, bringing me to sleep earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="quiet-the-music"&gt;Quiet the music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to listen to a radio station with a very talkative host at a volume that was a bit loud. I’ve since changed the station and turned down the volume. What has this changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, I would drift off into near-sleep during the music playing, only to snap out of it to listen to what the host had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By turning down the radio, no longer do I find myself actively listening to it and what the host has to say. Rather, I now use the radio as a distraction, to block out the background noises of my house, and I drift off during the constant music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This advice is probably going to yield the most variable response of the bunch, due to the different ways in which everyone responds to music. Some may find that turning off the music completely works better, while some may respond better to listening to something like pink noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="keep-a-notebook-and-pen-near"&gt;Keep a notebook and pen near&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final tweak stemmed from the issue which often plagued me, where ideas would come to me during the various stages of sleep, and I would have nowhere to write them down. Then, I would either forget them, or, if they were particularly good, scramble about my bedroom to find paper and pen to write the idea down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, this scrambling for paper would bring me back to being fully awake. One solution would be to trust my memory to remember my ideas, but I don’t like to leave those things to chance with my bad memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my solution to this was to keep a notebook and pen by my side in order to write down this waterfall of good ideas, and avoid forgetting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I find myself remembering more while sleeping easier with the knowledge that my ideas are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="make-three-simple-tweaks"&gt;Make three simple tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made three simple tweaks to my sleeping environment, and I’ve found myself falling asleep faster and getting more out of the time I spend doing so as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is entirely anecdotal and your success with each of these changes will vary. I make no guarantee that what works well for me will do the same for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to take away from this article? I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a long hard look at your habits while falling asleep. Consider what keeps you up at night, what isn’t working.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a list of small tweaks you could make to address some of your issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick three of your tweaks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Act upon your tweaks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate what’s working and what isn’t after a period of time (I would recommend a week at least).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. A simple guide to follow in order to make your falling asleep experience that much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a shot. Before you know it, you’ll be falling asleep faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The back of the head perspective</title>
    <published>2013-04-22T02:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-04-22T02:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/back-of-the-heads/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I attended a concert with a solo singer in front of a full orchestra. Concerts are wonderful, not just for their beautiful music but also for the interesting social dynamics and small details you notice in the performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the singer was belting out his lyrics, there were moments when the conductor of the orchestra would turn from his post and watch the singer in amazement at the great skill which the singer possessed. What struck me at that moment was a feeling of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the audience could see the singer’s facial expressions while singing, the conductor could only see the back of his head. “He’s missing out on half of the show!” I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that this is what it’s like to take part in such an ensemble. The audience experiences quite a different show than what those participating do. While we get to see the finished product, the final performance, there is much more to it than initially meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we miss out on as the audience are the thousands of little details that go into making the performance the wonderful experience we get to see. We miss the arranger labouring over his pieces, working out the best dynamics between the different sections. We miss the conductor looking through the music to find potential trouble points. We miss the sections working through their parts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, the audience, noticed only the final performance. But as the conductor watched the singer, I’m certain he was thinking of all the little details that had made up the final show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in the midst of &lt;em&gt;“We Have All the Time in the World,”&lt;/em&gt; it struck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “back of the head perspective,” or creator’s perspective, is present in &lt;strong&gt;all major projects&lt;/strong&gt;, and sharing it can bring even more value to your project than previously present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creator’s perspective is seeing your project go out into the wild, in whatever form that takes. It is looking at your project, which has more likely than not been like your baby, and knowing that most people who see it will see something completely different than what you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the conductor was looking at the singer, I would have loved to be in his head at that moment, to hear what he was thinking. To see what I was missing. To have been able to hear anecdotes about how the show was put together, some of the difficult times and some of the bright times, would really have increased the value I got out of it. To see the creator’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that day the value of this perspective, and how sharing your perspective can be one of the best things you could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that by sharing that creator’s perspective, those experiencing the final results can take away so much more from them, because they can appreciate more fully what went into their creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what value does this perspective hold? Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It allows you to look with pride on your results;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it allows you to reflect on your decisions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, it allows you to share with others the results of your actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="look-back-with-pride"&gt;Look back with pride.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaze upon your creation with a sense of pride. You did it, you accomplished your goals. That which you created is now in the wild and can be appreciated by all those who come across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reflect-on-your-decisions"&gt;Reflect on your decisions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubtless, when making your product you had to make many decisions. By looking at your product from the creator perspective, you can see all the decisions you made manifested in a final form, and evaluate how each of them affected the final product. This will help you learn and grow as you become better at decision making through self-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="share-the-results-of-your-actions-with-others"&gt;Share the results of your actions with others.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creator’s perspective allows you to share what you made with others. Beyond that, though, it allows you to share your reflections on your decisions with the world. This will help you to help others grow, which is a most rewarding result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s always someone who wants to learn by hearing how others accomplished what they are interested in doing. Why are tutorials and interviews so popular, if not because they offer insight into the creator’s perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out, look back on your products with a creator’s perspective, and be proud of what you made. But share that pride and what led up to it with the world. I’m sure there’s someone who’d love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Get more from talks by asking the right questions</title>
    <published>2013-04-17T01:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-04-17T01:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/get-more-from-talks/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="article-intro"&gt;What is the secret to getting the most out of talks? Getting &lt;em&gt;involved&lt;/em&gt; at talks. Just by changing from a listener to an engager, you will instantly get more out of events you attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, how to become an engager?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to ask them, the best way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prepare-questions-in-advance"&gt;Prepare questions in advance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the description of the session you’re attending ahead of time, and learn background info on your speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this will allow you to come up with questions that suit the speaker’s knowledge, your interests, and likely the interests of the session’s audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a list of pre-event questions? Great, now leave some room for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="write-down-new-questions-as-they-come-to-you"&gt;Write down new questions as they come to you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, as your speaker talks, new questions will come up. Add these to your list, in a separate section. We’ll come back to this separate section later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve got questions to ask, it’s time to ask them. But wait! There is a good time to ask them, and it’s probably not now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ask-your-questions-at-the-end"&gt;Ask your questions at the end&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most speakers include time at the end of their talk for questions. This is the best time to ask them! Although speakers will often say it’s okay to interrupt them at any time to ask questions, doing so will likely throw them off-course, meaning you may not get the best answer you could’ve hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, save your questions for the end. But, should you ask all of your questions? Probably not, at least not all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prioritize-which-questions-to-ask-when"&gt;Prioritize which questions to ask when&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look through your list of questions. It’s likely that many of the ones you prepared ahead of time do not fit in with the subject matter discussed. This is okay. Save these questions to ask at another time, perhaps privately in the halls or over email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So which questions do you ask during this question period?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask the questions everyone in the room can take something away from the answer of. These are the questions of immediate value, and more likely than not are the ones that you wrote down on that list from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking only questions which are relevant to the content delivered, you avoid wasting the time of the speaker and audience spent answering and listening to a question which likely doesn’t apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. A simple trick which you can use to get even more out of your talk-listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking the right questions at the right time, you as well as everyone else in the room will enjoy the event that much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go, ask your best questions. You’ll be making everybody’s time more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">An Idea for a CSS Markup Mover</title>
    <published>2013-02-05T01:20:00Z</published>
    <updated>2013-02-05T01:20:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/idea-for-css-markup-mover/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been working with responsively designed websites, and I’ve encountered an interesting problem. Currently in CSS, if we wish to “move” the location of a section of HTML content, we need to do so using sometimes ungainly CSS tricks. These include messing with &lt;code&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;position: fixed&lt;/code&gt;, which is hardly a bulletproof solution (just think what happens when your moved content suddenly grows to a size you didn’t expect, and suddenly it’s obscuring important content… yikes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of discussion, let’s imagine we have a menu which is at the bottom of the document in the HTML, thus putting it out of the way for mobile users. Here is the basic HTML to illustrate this structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/4710862.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the website is viewed on tablets, the menu is moved from the bottom of the page to beneath the site title and tagline, in a horizontal bar. When the website is viewed on a larger monitor, the menu is moved to being beside the title. (The CSS for this is rather simple, so I’ll leave it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could be done to fix this problem of dynamically-sized markup resizing and breaking your layout? There are a few options, with the last one being the main topic of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave the styles be and hope your layout won’t break.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restrict the markup in question from being over a certain size (through limitations put on the user via the CMS).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify in the CSS where the markup should logically move to in the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="option-1-leave-it-and-hope-it-wont-break"&gt;Option 1: Leave it and Hope It Won’t Break&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option is both the easiest and least ideal (isn’t it always this way?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this option, you just style the menu to always work a certain way, with certain expected parameters. You ignore all other possible use cases. This option is obviously the easiest, because it requires the least work, but it is not best due to the very static nature of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when a user adds another menu item and suddenly when the menu is viewed on a tablet, the extra menu item is obscuring your main content? This creates an issue, because the users can only have so many items in the menu using this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="option-2-restrict-markup"&gt;Option 2: Restrict Markup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, a user can only add a limited number of menu items which will only take up a certain width. This guarantees that your menu won’t break, because it’s restricted from going over the size at which content is obscured, but it also severely handicaps the user. Not a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="option-3-move-the-element"&gt;Option 3: Move the Element&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option is the most interesting and most effective of the three. Unfortunately, it also does not work at all, currently, but I’ll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, the markup for the menu is actually moved through the logical structure of the document. What do I mean by this? Well, assuming we have a document like described earlier, the menu markup is located after the content section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this option, when the website is viewed on a tablet screen size a media query is triggered. When this media query is triggered, the menu markup moves from after the content section to before it, and is restyled to appear as a bar. The exact same idea works when moving to a larger screen size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear here, we’re not styling the element to appear to have moved elsewhere else in the document structure, but rather we are &lt;em&gt;actually moving the interpreted place of the markup&lt;/em&gt; in the logical document structure. It has the same effect as if we had cut-n-pasted the markup in a different location in our HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how does the CSS know where to “move” the markup when it is supposed to be moved? For that, I propose a “target” or “placeholder” element, if you will, which represents a space in the document structure that is occupied by a block of markup under certain conditions. Here, I will use a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;placeholder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposed-html--css"&gt;Proposed HTML &amp;amp; CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how could we modify our basic webpage to implement this? Here is my proposed methodology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/4710939.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the source there, I have added two &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;placeholder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements, each with a unique ID. These IDs will be used when targeting the placeholders as targets for the movement of the markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how would the CSS move the markup? For this, too, I have a proposal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/4710989.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can be seen here, the CSS moves the markup by setting the &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; property of an element to the ID of a placeholder within the document. When this happens, the browser interprets the markup as being not in its original location in the document structure, but rather as being moved to wherever the placeholder is located. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a taste of what I’m proposing, here are some advantages and disadvantages associated with this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="advantages"&gt;Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This markup movement can be extremely useful! No longer will our layouts be broken by unknowing users, and no longer do we have to employ nasty CSS “hacks” which put our layout at risk. This is a very good thing for those doing responsive layouts where UI elements have to move when the website is viewed on a different screen size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="disadvantages"&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve seen how this can be used for good, it’s time for me to play devil’s advocate to myself and explain why this may not be the perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This methodology is questionable in its semantics. What do I mean by that? Well, CSS is generally regarded as being the controller of style and presentation within a website, while HTML is the controller of layout and document structure. Here, CSS is moving around elements of the document structure not just visually, but also logically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logical movement can be seen as being outside of the realm of CSS. Is it going to far by actually moving where the content is interpreted? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this method relies on a new element, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;placeholder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Should an element which is used solely for the purpose of styling exist? While some may disagree, Mike Robinson points out on &lt;em&gt;HTML5 Doctor&lt;/em&gt; that the role of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, may be (at least partially) that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="block-quote"&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;You should use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when there is no other more semantically appropriate element that suits your purpose. Its most common use will likely be for stylistic purposes --- i.e., wrapping some semantically marked-up content in a CSS-styled container.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://html5doctor.com/you-can-still-use-div/" title="You can still use div"&gt;You can still use div&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; by Mike Robinson (via HTML5 Doctor).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems to be at least somewhat acceptable for an element to exist which is used solely for styling. But the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is different in that it can be used for other things, such as creating semi-semantic containers when necessary, or other such jobs. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;placeholder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element which I suggest does no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible solution to this is to, instead of using a new element, use the proposed &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; CSS property to say where the markup should move &lt;em&gt;relative to an existing element&lt;/em&gt;. What do I mean by this? Perhaps this code would help to demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/asdfgh746/4711456.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we say that the markup should be moved in the document structure relative to already existing elements. For tablet devices, this means positioning it after the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, and for desktop devices it means positioning it after the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element contained within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. We use regular CSS selectors to select the element we wish to position it after. If we wanted to position it before, we would substitute &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; in the code with &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would allow for us to avoid any extra markup, but it does make the position of the moved markup less concrete (for example, what happens if there are more than one &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage of this method is that there currently exists no implementation for it! If someone is willing to work with me to develop one, as a JavaScript solution or similar, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion-and-next-steps"&gt;Conclusion and Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve outlined a problem here and my proposed solution to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when we have a responsive layout and we try to move a UI element around, that moved UI element could break our layout if the user unknowingly makes it too large or something of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposed solution is the creation of a new HTML element, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;placeholder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a CSS property, &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;, which dictate where the markup in question should be moved to in the logical document structure. This allows us to create responsive websites which are more receptive to the very dynamic nature of web publishing today, and still preserve our carefully crafted layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see this implemented in some way, but it is of course important to take into account the semantics of the new elements being created. That said, I still believe it is a good solution to our problem, and would love to work with someone to make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this lengthy, long-winded proposal. Perhaps I’ll release a much more succinct version in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">A Most Irrational Fear</title>
    <published>2012-12-11T01:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-12-11T01:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/skating-rinks/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; This is a story talking about an aspect of my silly childhood. With that in mind, remember that it is a story about my life as a 4-year old and what may sound preposterous was at the time very real to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Canada, skating is an awesome skill because by the time winter rolls around it seems like every friend has a skating rink in their backyard, and schools take trips to skating rinks for fun. Learning to skate, then, is an important part of a childhood where you’re not relegated to cling to the boards whilst your hockey-playing friends race each other around the rink, practicing their sharp stops and backwards skating skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure my childhood would not be devoid of this necessary component, my parents signed me up for skating lessons at a local rink when I was around 4 or 5 years old. To prepare for these lessons, we went out and bought a set of second-hand skates (protip: always buy second-hand for things like skates, and resell them afterwards) at the local used sporting goods store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So life kept on rolling until the night before the big day, the night before my first ever skating lesson. I was so excited, I’d finally be able to go on the ice and skate and it would be so liberating. However, before I fell asleep that night, a seed of an idea which had been implanted in my head blossomed into a terrifying (and highly irrational) fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 4 year old self had somehow gotten the idea into his head that all ice rinks are built on top of bodies of water like a pond, even the indoor ones. Having learnt some of the basics of ice safety, I knew that it didn’t take much to crack thin pond ice, and when that happened you could fall into the freezing water below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these ideas in mind, I somehow contrived that the 6 year old students who already knew how to skate would skate in circles around me. As I wallowed on the ice, trying to skate but constantly falling, their sharp blades would cut a circle out of the ice. So there I would be, sitting on a circle of ice that had been separated from the rest of the rink. Not understanding physics whatsoever, I then guessed that this circle of ice would sink to the bottom of the fictional body of water that lay beneath the surface of the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was just a silly childhood fear, but at the time it was very real. I was certain that the horrible, cruel, 6 year olds would for some inexplicable reason decide to cut a hole out of the ice rink and I would sink to the bottom of the water that lay below, a horrible death for a 4 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/wcto-developers-2012/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday night, I arrived home after one of the best weekends I’ve had in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this weekend so awesome for me was my attendance at &lt;a href="http://2012.torontodev.wordcamp.org/" title="WordCamp Toronto: Developers 2012"&gt;WordCamp Toronto: Developers 2012&lt;/a&gt; (WCTO). Hosted by George Brown College in downtown Toronto, it was a meeting of some of the coolest people around, united by the fact that we were all WordPress developers, or interested in becoming one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="prelude"&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the WordCamp a couple of months ago, when I saw that there would be not one but two WordCamps in Toronto this year. Never having attended one before, I was immediately interested in going. I saw that there would be both an end user and a developers conference. I decided I would attend the developers, which would be more relevant and interesting to me. Not to mention, when I finally decided on going to WCTO, the end users conference was already very soon and I wouldn’t have been able to get ready in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all the administrative overhead of buying a ticket and finding a place to stay overnight was out of the way, it was time to wait excitedly for the big weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-week-before"&gt;The Week Before&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before WCTO rolled around, I came down with a pretty bad cold. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to make it but thanks to the marvels of modern medicine, I was feeling much better by the time of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got myself packed and ready to go, prepared for a weekend of learning and hanging out with some of the coolest people around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-night-before"&gt;The Night Before&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Toronto Friday night. I would be staying at the conference hotel that night, before heading to the house of some relatives who live nearby for the Saturday night. Checked in, I walked around Toronto and saw some neat stuff (the city is a great place to walk around, always something to see or do). After that, I returned to the hotel ready to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to sleep, however, I sent out a Tweet (using my Twitter account which I had recently created) asking if anyone wanted to hang out with a young student developer at the event. Before long, the fantastic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brentkobayashi" title="Brent Kobayashi (brentkobayashi) on Twitter"&gt;Brent Kobayashi&lt;/a&gt; replied to me, saying he hoped to see me at the there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this comforting Tweet in my mind, I went to sleep looking forward to what would end up being a very long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-1-people-sessions-and-more-people"&gt;Day 1: People, Sessions, and More People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come the first day, I arrived at the building and checked myself in (alone, to the surprised looks of the wonderful ladies manning the sign-in booth), getting my name tag and loot bag. I then entered the main hall where the opening ceremonies would take place and took a seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, a man came up the stairs towards me and asked if I was Lucas, to which I replied that yes, I was he. He introduced himself as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tddewey" title="Taylor D Dewey (tddewey) on Twitter"&gt;Taylor Dewey&lt;/a&gt; and said he had seen my Tweet the night before. We talked and it turned out he was one of the speakers whose talks I was planning on attending - once this came up, we discussed the topic he would be presenting and I learnt some background info which helped me out when it came time for the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meeting Taylor, I met another cool developer named &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markoheijnen" title="Marko Heijnen (markoheijnen) on Twitter"&gt;Marko Heijnen&lt;/a&gt; who, as it turned out, had been part of a team to rewrite the image manipulation code in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day proceeded, and I went to various talks on neat subjects with fantastic speakers, meeting lots of interesting people along the way. I did get to meet Brent, who is a great guy that really made me feel welcome and part of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I met all had an interesting story to share. I think this is something I see more and more as I spend more time in the “real world,” that everybody has a unique story to share and that they’re all worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, I was exhausted and ready for a good meal and plenty of sleep. I didn’t attend the after party (much to my regret), mostly because I didn’t think I’d be comfortable in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-2-a-few-more-sessions-and-reinforcing-connections"&gt;Day 2: A Few More Sessions, and Reinforcing Connections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, I attended some more sessions and reinforced my connections which I had made the previous day. I talked with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pjohanneson" title="Patrick Johanneson (pjohanneson) on Twitter"&gt;Patrick Johanneson&lt;/a&gt;, who is the developer for the website of the University of Brandon in Manitoba, a job which poses some interesting challenges which Patrick and I had a good time discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day really ended up being a shorter version of the first (which is a good thing, I couldn’t take two full-day learning sessions in a row). At the end of the day, closing ceremonies were held, in which I got an extra T-Shirt (in my size, even) and saw the end of a great event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the conference, I had learnt a bunch, but more importantly, I had met a lot of really good people. The developers that I met at WCTO are truly my peers. With them, I can hold discussions that I value and build relationships which are strong and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the folks who went out of their way to sit down and talk with me, it did wonders in making me feel welcome and comfortable at the event. After all, being one of the youngest people in the room can be a little daunting! You are all great people who I hope I can remain in touch with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so glad I went to WCTO this year, it was an unforgettable experience that I will definitely do again. Perhaps in future years I’ll even present!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Making of ecustom.ca</title>
    <published>2012-11-02T22:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-11-02T22:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/the-making-of/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article is a mini-essay explaining the history of ecustom.ca as well as a more in-depth look at how I built the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a little background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="history"&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This humble website has gone through a few major iterations since I registered the domain in March of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the website was a static HTML/CSS mess of code. It was ugly, had silly little experiments all over it, and generally did not reflect well on me or my skillset. I made minor changes to this version for the next few months, before one day deciding it was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point in my life I was looking to write articles and tutorials on my site, so I wanted to move to a platform that would allow me to easily create and publish my works.
I decided WordPress was a good candidate. I had experience with it before when I took it for a test run on my local development server. I also had plans to use it for client sites due to its increasing ubiquity and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I deployed the latest version of WordPress on to ecustom.ca. I’m not sure the exact version number, but it was definitely pre-3.0. I jumped around with various themes, never having the time to create my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually 3.0 came around and I decided to use Thematic as a theme framework and create a child theme from there. My “child theme” didn’t amount to much, just some colour modifications in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a note to myself to one day change it, to make it more my own, but I never got around to doing so… until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, a coding fever descended upon me. I simply had to create something, to tackle some project. That project ended up being the new version of ecustom.ca&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-simple-static-basis"&gt;A Simple Static Basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I knew I wanted out of my new site was a focus on text. I’ve been reading a lot lately on text and typographical conventions and I wanted to put some of my knowledge to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my process with a design that I sketched out on some of my trusty graph paper. From there, I hopped into Sublime Text 2 and began laying out a basic framework from which to work off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework evolved into my article view, likely how you’re reading this now. It places a focus on the comfortable reading and consumption of text content, one of my focuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made sure the body text was big (20px, although I use ems) in an elegant font (Georgia) to put the text at the forefront of the website experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with different colours and blocking schemes before deciding on this one, which is simple and clean. Once I had this layout created I proceeded to work on the other layouts I would need, namely the main page, non-article page, and article listing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the pieces were all in place as a static placeholder framework, it was time to bring some dynamic-ness to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-dynamic-publishing-system"&gt;A Dynamic Publishing System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the time came to make the site dynamic, I had several options available to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, most obvious, option was to call back to the previous version of the site and use WordPress. I did consider this option for a while, as I figured it would be a logical step. However, after much deliberation I made the choice to not use WordPress but rather a static-site generator. The reasons for this are numerous, but I will leave that for another article to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what a static-site generator is, it’s essentially a program that runs on your local computer and compiles a website for you, which you then publish via ftp to your server. The output files are all static HTML/CSS, but the input files can be in many formats. Essentially you get the benefits of WordPress and similar database-based publishing systems, but without the associated server lag and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had decided a static-site generator was the way I would go, I had to pick one that suited my needs and that I wanted to use. At the time, I was using Python a lot, so I naturally wanted to find a generator that was built in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I evaluated &lt;a href="http://hyde.github.com/" title="hyde"&gt;hyde&lt;/a&gt; as an option to suit my needs. However I couldn’t get it installed so I never actually got to see how well it worked. From there, I wanted to look at hyde’s Ruby counterpart, &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="jekyll"&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, as my generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with jekyll I came upon an issue which I had also with hyde, and many of the other generators I looked at. Looking over the code for the generators, I found that they hadn’t received any updates in quite a while. While I understand that isn’t necessarily the most important thing to look at, it was important to me that whatever project I go with has a developer that is still actively working on it. This gives me the opportunity to suggest improvements and possibly see them integrated with the project, something I wouldn’t be able to do with a dead project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after I had looked at several generators, I came upon one which I had seen a while ago, on the previous version of &lt;a href="http://danharper.me/" title="Dan Harper"&gt;Dan Harper&lt;/a&gt;’s website. This generator was &lt;a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" title="nanoc"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;, a Ruby-based static-site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enter-nanochttpnanocstoneshiporg-nanoc"&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" title="nanoc"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I use nanoc to build this website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first took all the layouts and using the basic framework I had created at the start, created a “default” layout which the content of each page is loaded into. Depending on the page, other layouts would be rendered into this default layout, and the content would then be placed within this sub-layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created my directory/permalink structure. All the articles would be located under “/articles/”, and other pages would reside at the top level (“/”). This keeps my permalinks short and my directory structure clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I started porting over the content I had written, and started to write the Ruby scripts that would allow nanoc to create the pages of my site that were more “dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious “dynamic” page would be the &lt;a href="/articles/" title="Articles"&gt;Articles listing page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists out all the articles in chronological order and shows a title, an optional excerpt (displays the whole article if excerpt not found), as well as a link to the full article. I can replace the text of the link if I so choose, to customize it to suit the piece of writing. nanoc has built-in methods to list out the articles in order, and this allows me to just write articles and know that they will be included in my article list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single article view is also nicely done with nanoc, most notably the date listing at the bottom. With nanoc, I simply specify in my article file that it was written on some date (let’s say November 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; as this one was) and, along with some help from a date formatter, I can print out the number in correct ordinal format. For example, November 2, 2012, becomes the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; of November, 2012. Because nanoc allows me to use Ruby code to help generate the output, I can use any Ruby code to help me with the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I could have done this all in WordPress, or even creating all the static files myself (although that may have been signs of depression on my part), but I have decided that nanoc has fit my needs wonderfully. It has been a joy to work with, and as I write this article I know that my site will generate perfectly, without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-benefits-of-nanoc"&gt;Other Benefits of nanoc&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using nanoc also provides me some additional benefits. Namely, I get to open-source my whole website! That’s right, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746/ecustom.ca" title="GitHub - asdfgh746/ecustom.ca"&gt;code for this site&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub. You’ll need nanoc to generate it, but you can look through it and hopefully learn about the operation of nanoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the code being open-source and available on GitHub, it also means the entire site is managed by git. This means that I can version control all my articles and versions of my site. No more WordPress revisions which kinda-sorta make sense, just commits which I manage and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nanoc also gives me the benefit of being able to use a variety of formatting technologies. From HTML to Markdown, I’ve got the full spectrum of choice available to me. Even better, any publishing system which has a Ruby gem works with nanoc. This means technology like SASS can also be integrated, with little trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fun benefit is that I got to work with a cool technology which I haven’t before, and I now know of a program I can use to create simple static sites for clients depending on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ecustom.ca is powered by &lt;a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" title="nanoc"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt;, a super-cool static-site generator which allows me to focus on my writing, which is a priority now as I try to write and publish more. If you have any questions about nanoc, feel free to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll do my best to sort you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website has been through a couple of major iterations now, with the current version being v3.0. I however, prefer to think of this as a completely new version. To assign it a version number greater than 1.0 would be to imply that it is in some way related to the previous versions. In reality, it is different in all ways, even the name, and as such deserves to have its version counter reset. This is v1.0 of ecustom.ca. Welcome to the party, I look forward to enjoying it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Mr. Al Chez!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I had a life-changing experience brought about by the actions of a man who wants little more than to inspire and bring joy to the hearts of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man I speak of is Mr. Al Chez, professional trumpet player and musician extraordinaire. Al is a very talented musician, playing trumpet for over 40 years (he started when he was 9 years old!), working with the likes of Bon Jovi and Tower of Power. The fact that Al has worked with Bon Jovi made me want to meet this man, not to mention his extensive trumpet and life experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how is it that I got the extremely fortunate opportunity to work with this incredible man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a trumpet player in my school’s jazz ensemble/band, playing tunes such as &lt;em&gt;Vehicle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fly Me to the Moon&lt;/em&gt;. Al, who was in the area for a concert, decided to make a stop by our school to work with the jazz band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received the news on Wednesday that he would be coming to work with the jazz band, and that his scheduled day to come in would be Thursday… the very next day, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when my teacher informed me that he would be coming by, I had no idea who Al was. So I, being the Google addict I am, immediately took to the Internet to learn what I could about Al. The results were astonishing, and I was very excited to meet him the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So jazz practice rolls around, and Al arrives right on time. We started off with Al introducing himself and some of his background, and then got right into practicing some of our pieces with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that Al brought the level of the ensemble’s playing up significantly, but even more so I feel that he had a profound impact on my playing and my passion for trumpet. I have played trumpet for over 2 years now, and in all that time I have never truly &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the instrument. That is all different now. I, in recent days, have started to view it in a different way and I view playing and being a musician in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Al’s visit, he mentioned the concert he was in town for. It turned out we as students could go and get tickets for $10 if we wanted to attend; needless to say, I was immediately interested and made plans to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come the night of the concert, I met up with a friend at the theatre where Al and his band would be playing, and we proceeded to our seats looking forward to a great night of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show far exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band which played was comprised of a number of musicians from Al’s band in the USA, as well as a host of local talent who joined in and practiced with the others for a week or so before the show. The pieces were all fantastically done, they sounded awesome and we left in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write this to say thank you to Al for being such an awesome guy (can’t call him “dude,” he says it’s not allowed) and taking the time to come and work with our band. Al and his incredible passion for the trumpet has brought to me a passion I never saw in myself before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Al, I now play “for the whole world, every time I play.” To Al, I can only say thank you for that gift. I hope one day to be as awesome as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the experience was incredible. Al has changed my life for the better, all out of the goodness and passion of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only regret: not going up to the man and giving him a big shake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is it. The new version of ecustom.ca. One could call it version 3.0, after several major iterations previous, but I prefer to think of it as version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new ecustom.ca, I am moving on from my previous delusions of grandeur in using the website as a selling point for my business. Now, ecustom.ca represents me, and me alone, as my personal website. With that, I am moving my branding away from one of a company style to one where I am the brand. I feel this is the best way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may migrate some of my posts over from the old ecustom.ca, but that remains to be seen based on what I believe to be the quality of those articles not fitting in with the new standards I am setting for myself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I plan to publish some good pieces of journalism, from objective essays to more personal, emotional pieces. I know that I have plenty of great content planned; the test will be how regularly I will be able to create and share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a coming post detailing the technology powering the website, as well as a more detailed history of ecustom.ca throughout the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, welcome to my new home! Feel free to send me comments and feedback through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lchski"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Lady on the Bus</title>
    <published>2012-10-15T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-10-15T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://ecustom.ca/articles/the-lady-on-the-bus/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every morning I witness several acts of compassion which bring a smile to my face without fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These acts all occur on my morning bus ride to school, during which a woman with a walking disability boards the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act of compassion occurs when, inevitably, the lady has difficulty arriving at her bus stop on time. She lives not too far from the stop, but her disability causes her to have trouble getting there. Fortunately for her, the fantastic bus drivers will stop, pick up the people at the stop (as they are required to do), then proceed until they see her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon seeing her walking towards the stop, the bus driver will again stop, just to let her on board. This occurs nearly ever morning, and it never fails to bring a smile to the face of everyone involved: the lady, smiling with gratitude; the bus driver, happy to have been of service; and nearly every onlooker who witnesses this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this covers one of the acts of compassion. This one is well seen, and appreciated. The next two acts are not as often witnessed, nor immediately appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the woman boards the bus, one of two things usually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the people sitting on the bus see the trouble the woman has with walking, they want to help her, to give her a seat so she doesn’t have to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous times, I have seen people near the front of the bus (nearest to the woman once she boards) vacate their seat so the woman can sit down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw something I hadn’t yet seen, an act of compassion which again aimed to create a seat for the lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, the bus rolled up to the stop, as usual, then continued on its way. The bus stopped again shortly after to let the woman on board. As she stood at the front counting otu her fare, the man beside me reached forward to the bank of seats in front of him (which are folded up to allow for wheelchairs or strollers if necessary) and unfolded them. This was to allow the woman to sit there, to have plenty of room for when she had to get off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, earlier I mentioned that these latter acts often go unappreciated. Every day, as people vacate or unfold chairs for this woman, she prefers to stand. Now, I have no issue with this. She may have difficulty sitting or standing up, which would explain her preference to remain standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thanks-a-pledge-and-a-plea"&gt;Thanks, A Pledge, and a Plea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I write this is to say thank you, to make a pledge, and to make a plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, thanks. Thanks to the woman who vacated her seat, to the man who lowered the folded seats for the woman, to the numerous drivers who have stopped for the woman when she couldn’t make it to her stop on time. Especially thanks to those who make room for the woman. While she may never sit in the seats which you make available to her, know that you’ve done a good thing, I commend all involved for their actions, everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a pledge. I pledge to thank those who perform actions in order to make the lives of others easier or better. To thank those who go out of their way to help others, especially those who do so without their efforts being appreciated. They deserve it, they are the unsung heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a plea. Let this article be a plea to all, a plea to do as I have pledged, to say, “Thank you,” to those who perform an action to make the life of another better. Pledge to say thanks, and we’ll make this world better, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
